you have to be careful or it willn't work properly.
Adam, let me see.
how did you attach that?
that's good.
shall we put this away and find something else?
we could put this in the box.

careful, Adam.
show your Mother and ask her if it's safe.
I don't think so.
I know what you can do.
just take one paper and then find one that you'd like to make.
why don't you use some of the other tape that Ursula gave you?
why don't you use some of this?
not cut it off.

the keyhole in your door is closed up.
I don't think that's the way you put it in.
I think you do it with screws and a screwdriver, Adam.
right there is one.
you had one in your pocket.
careful.
ok, that's enough.
careful.
Adam, you're just walking over her feet.
careful.
no no no, Adam.
you might break that off.
no, I don't think you should do that.
let's see if I could find a board around here and you might
put it on the board.
if you sit down you can.
careful.
yes, if you're careful.
where's my key?
are you going to put it on?
what do you need this for?
alright.
you put it in.
do it on the floor first.
put your lock in on the floor.
be careful and don't lose the screws.
ouch, Adam.
you don't need that.
I don't think you need that either.
ok, now you do it.
can you screw it with a screwdriver?
why not?
I'll hold it while you screw it
no, you don't need this at all.
what would you use it for?
no.
because we need that on the door.
it already has a lock in it, I think.
can you screw this?
that's part of the lock.
ok, we'll put that on
yes, that's to take it off.
no, you can put it in a little further.
no no, you don't need that.
put your screw back in.
where's your screwdriver?
have you looked in there?
look in there.
what do you see?
I see my Harvard shirt.
that's not a Harvard shirt.
look that way, what do you see?
look through the other end and see what you see.
wood?
wood on what?
you see the wood of the hammer.
wood or word?
we'll see what happens when you put a key in the lock.
yes.
whoops, you missed.
where do you put the keys?
is that the right key?
I don't know.
try that.
no no, don't push it in.
is it turned?
I'll hold it and you turn it and see what happens.
ok, Adam.
come in.
hello, Adam, how're you today?
you didn't know I was home, did you?
where were you, Adam?
from Pembroke?
did you have a nice time in Pembroke?
what did you do?
you played?
you played with the kitty?
what was the kitty's name?

Putty?
that's a funny name for a kitty.
what else did you do?
with a rocket ship?
oh, what was the name of the rocket ship?
a violin?
that's a funny name for a rocket ship.
where're you going?
where is Ursula going?
what?
can you knock on the what?
Adam, you could draw some pictures now.
you drew a picture once?
you don't have a mailbox up here.
to Robin?
alright.
that's very nice.
Robin will read it?
by himself?
he's been to school for one day.
why should he cry in school?
why would he want to?
because Shadow_Gay spanked him.
some little paper off?
well, draw on this.
you're going to do what?
a kitty's name.
look in the other end, Adam.
turn it over.
turn them around.
you can't see the cowboy that way?
careful.
let's see if I see you.
yes, I see you.
well, write on the paper.
well, don't write on it.
yes, a funny man.
no, you can't take it out.
he doesn't have any arms.
where do you think his arms are?
now how do you get the head over in the back?
the pen?
try to write with it.
is that a man?
why don't you write something?
with the pen.
write your name.
will read your name?
what do you write with?
bird?
what's the bird doing?
you have to put one up before you can put the other down.
does this write?
she showed you one time.
whose name are you writing?
Shadow_Gay.
where has Shadow_Gay been?
I haven't seen Shadow_Gay in a long time.

would you like to do the puzzle that was in this morning's paper?
ok.
you have so many pencils.
you lost your footie ballie.
do you see the puzzle?
I'm hiding, Adam.
I wouldn't know.
what did the puzzle say?
right here.
what?
I don't see the puzzle.
don't do that.
you might hurt yourself.
there isn't a puzzle this morning.
I don't know.
Adam, do you want to put this on the key chain?
let's see.
you come and look, Adam.
Adam.
come and look.
you hold the key.
this is where it has to go.
alright.
well, don't play with it.
how can you get it on?
no, I'm asking you.
no no, Adam, you'll break it that way.
maybe you just have to push it on, Adam.
you knocked my glasses off.
did it?
why did it frighten you?
I heard a little click.
click click click?
what about the door?
what's the governor's name?
my pocket.
I found a penny on the floor.
we don't need it?
what else do we need?
whoops, you missed it.
alright.
don't knock me.
if a carpenter knocks what does a plumber do?
who puts the door in?
a carpenter?
alright, carpenter Adam.
hmm?
I'm a nut?
did he say mmhm?
he was a nice carpenter, wasn't he?
you didn't get in his way?
oh very good.
what is that?
binoculars.
I'm waiting for you to put the other door hinge on.
you missed.
yes, three times you missed.
ok.

how many times?
what do you do when you go to school, Adam?
what do you think Robin is doing in school?
playing with your bunny.
with your cowboy bunny?
cowboy hat in school?
some little screws in.
in the binoculars.
I don't really know that they're screws.
however it's put together.
I don't think you need to take it apart.
no, I think these must be David's .
perhaps his Mother bought them for him.
why not?
well, how can you throw them away and keep them too?
this one doesn't look like all the others.
yeah.
ok.
take it off.
yes.
yes, but I don't see another one like that.
shake all your keys inside and then just push down the snap.
no.
no.
to the door.
why we don't have a lock to fit the key.
because we couldn't find the key to fit it.
I guess we didn't buy the right one.
you know how this works, Adam?
do you see anything happening?
turn it the other way.
ok.
I'll get it started.
when you what?
no no no, not over there.
where's your rain hat?
yes.
where is it?
maybe it's in the bag.
it's what?
oh, it's a game.
he just had a nap.
yes, that'll hurt him.
that will too.
he'll put it in his mouth.
yes, he puts everything in his mouth.
it's just where he had his head down on the blanket and it left a
well, sometimes you do when you wake up from your nap.
because you have your head in one place for such a long time.
are your hands washed?
don't .
he's telling a story.
no no, careful, Adam.
a frog.
careful, Adam.
don't play with the record.
I can't see what it says.
who's that?
that's your bunny with the funny name.
what's the bunny's name?
buttyc?
something to drink.
I don't have anything but some milk.
would you like some milk?
well, why don't we pick some of the toys up first.
no, so you can't spill it.
your what?
these go back in Ursula's bag.
except for the key case.
you could keep that.
what?
mmhm.
well, pick them up and put them in.
did you pick all of them up?
I found one that you missed.
careful.
because it was in there.
no.
see these on the end?
they're there so you can open them.
let's see if this is as tall as you are.
no.
careful.
why not?
because you broke it.
that's right.
very good, Adam.
I'm sorry I wrote on you, Adam.

what would you like its name to be?
big what?
you tore off a hole?
he doesn't want a little piece.
what is that?
no, don't kick that.
it's not a ball.

that's very pretty.
where did you find that?
in a vase?
in water?
no?
yes.
oh, to keep you company.
oh, I may?

I thought you wanted her to read you a story.
I think that might be something of Daddy's .
banana?
that doesn't look like a banana.
where is a story?
oh, you mean the Humpty_Dumpty.
no no, Adam.
that hurts Paul.
sounded like he said yeah.
do you have a favorite story?
they took a bus to the hardware store.
did you take a bus?

you might fall and hurt yourself.
you'd like one of those?

no no, don't play over there, dear.
oh, nothing.
just a tiny part of the petal.
no no, Adam.
no no, Adam.
no, the flowers aren't going anyplace.
they can't carry you anyplace.
oh, you wouldn't want to hang him up, would you?
why?
Paul would like that.
no no, don't throw him like that.
he likes to ride in the lake.
why don't you let him sit in the chair.
why don't you tell him a story.
do you know a story he might like?
what?
well, tell him one.
once upon a time.
we can't hear you with your fingers in your mouth.
that was a nice story.
it sounded like part of red riding hood and somebody else.
huh?
with the what?
what is what?
I don't know.
what do you think is happening?
alright, you watch and tell us what's happening?
isn't that what the doctor did to Paul yesterday?
he's checking her to see whether she's alright or not.
do you want to watch, Adam?
is that right?
no?
or did you say I want a watch?
it works?
yes, it should go in there.
very gently.
because he's small.
well yes, only he doesn't like to play very noisy games.
he has feathers.
if he falls like that he'll lose some of his feathers.
yes, he will.
that's a good idea, Adam.
open what?
are you having fun?
no, it's not broken.
oh yes, that doesn't go under there.
well, you don't want it to get a flat tire, do you?
no, Adam, don't put anything else under there.
you let the marbles drive.
careful, Adam.
you may break the crayons, dear.
be gentle.
why're you taking them out?
Adam was going to bed and he saw it.
careful, don't put those letters under there, honey.
I don't know how you'll get them out.
watching them push that thing over?
what is that thing they're pushing over?
oh, the top to the car.
oh, what do you do in your office?
what kind of work?
some pretty work?
you do bad work?
when I touch Paul?
you're going to spank me to pieces?
oh.
more what in?
where're they going?
no, you don't need water in that.
oh no, that's for a doll.

isn't there a hole in it?
well, that's the cover to keep the germs out of the nipple.
mmhm.
that's the nipple and other is the cover.
no no, Adam.
no no no.
because that's for a doll.
no no, honey, he's not a doll, he's a baby.
it what?
a cooking set.
you said you have a stove, Adam.
you're going to give the baby the bottle?
it's a pan.
for cooking things.
that's the pan for cooking.
a frying pan.
yes.
what do you think that's for?
I don't have any sugar.
where's a train track?
that's a pad for washing pans.
no, just pretend.
yes.
no, but you haven't cooked anything yet.
yes, but you haven't cooked anything.
no no no, you cook out here.
yes.
why don't you and make a stove.
make this your stove.
well, honey, make this your kitchen.
this will be your kitchen.
they're going to burn the house?
the firemen come to put the fire out so the house won't burn.
it wouldn't be safe to leave it standing like that.
so that it willn't fall on anybody.
yes, because somebody could get burned.
alright.
ok.
did you tell Ursula what you did the other day when you were
he put the plate down and then took all the silverware and put it

you'll give the duck your hands and then you'll be a duck?
you will be a duck with a hand.
oh, you're going to get married?
oh, with the duck.
you're boiling water?
yes.
I guess I needed it to sew something.

in case something tears.
I don't know what might tear.
oh, he's going to eat outside?
why?
oh, are we having a picnic?
no no no, Adam.
he didn't mean to.
that's alright.
Adam doesn't understand that you don't know what you're doing.
what kind of fish are you having, Adam?
it looks like a bottle opener.
yes, thank you.
I'd like some Seven_up.
no no, don't play with that.
Seven_up?
you're going to drink some Seven_up.

on the tray?
oh, she's going to eat up there where she's sitting.
there's a tray.
why don't you use that tray?
no no no.
no more trays.
the duck can share a tray with me.
well, you go sit in the chair with her, beside the chair.
you could use this tray and I could use my lap.
what are you serving?
here, Paul, here's a pretend for you.
oh, he was just visiting Paul while you were busy doing something
you were cooking Paul said.
thank you.
a pencil, I think.

that does look like an al.
I don't think there's anything in there.

well, my hands are even bigger, so how will we get them out?
alright.

I'm sorry.
I thought it was ready.

oh no, I think he'll put it in his mouth.
mmhm.
because I wanted to know.
I can make you another spoon.
what?
he will?
no, he doesn't play with the scissors.
those are tweezers.
for picking up things.
you want a knife?
careful now.
it frightened you, didn't it?
here's a butter knife.
yes, that's yours.
he doesn't want you to play with it because it's his and he
yes.
what did I do to him?
no, you took it away.
I don't think that was a worm.
I think that was a snake maybe.
I put it away.
in my purse.
in this purse.
no.
it's just a toy snake.
it's just a toy snake.
play with it.
no, you play games with it.
must be a bug?
I just want to see what else is in there.
no, Adam.
there are no batteries in it.
maybe David did.
after you open it.
no.
I see a what?
a nut?

yes.
it was a snake.
it's a shell.
it sounds like the ocean.
it's a sea shell.
no, it's a real shell.
if you listen very carefully you can hear something that sounds like
hear the waves?
no.
some little sea creature was in there once.
you let Bobof hear it.
you have to put it up very close to your ear.
that sounds like the stove?
what part of the stove sounds like that?
yes.
from the ocean.
hmm?
no, it's all gone, all put away.
I put it away.
in my purse.
it's just a toy, it can't crawl.
careful now.
no no no, don't break it, Adam.
oh, you're going to get married?
oh.
what happens when you get married?
where's the zipper?
here it is.
let's close the door, alright?
that's right.

you're a kitten?

why do you want one more, Adam?
or marbles?
let's have marbles.
this is your mixing bowl.
yes, I think we do.
yes.
no.
no.
what is this?
no, I don't have any cookie cutters at all.
are you going to make a valentine cookie?
Adam, how do you make the cookie dough?
you're making what?
bread?
yes, I guess.
no, she has nothing else.
finished?
alright.
yes, you may put that in there.
well, there're some more behind you.
here's another one.
shall I get the crayons?
whoops.
maybe we can attach it to two chairs.
shall I tie it from here to here.
alright.
yes.
oh, you have some pins.
shall I make it straight, Adam?
mmhm.
what?
I'll bring some handkerchiefs.
let's hang some Kleenex up.
oh, you're smiling back?
yes, you may use all you can.
why, I don't think you'd need to use all of it.
that's a nice white wash.
while your clothes dry?
this is the dining room?
oh, right here.
oh, that's the kitchen.
you have two kitchens.
why do you have two?
nothing.
I just put some out here.
why is Bozo going to eat with the chickens?
oh, he may spill the food.
oh, I didn't know you had any chickens.
playing?
playing?
you'll play cowboys and Indians after supper?
why are the Indians bad?
well, why are the Indians bad?
but that's the living room.
you said that was the living room and this is the kitchen and this
alright.
it's a nice kitchen.
I may look at them in the kitchen.
the bowl?
the bowl for what?
a beater.
you call it an egg beater.
what are we having for supper?
clotheslines.
just a minute.
you're going to have some water tea?
oh, thank you.
that's Ursula's .
you said this was mine.
that's very good tea.
oh no, I haven't finished that yet.
I had so much.
mine is so much larger than yours.
careful.
why is the kitchen right here?
no no no.
why is the kitchen right here?
no no no.
don't put that so far.
you'll be on the cord.
oh, Bozo's bottle.
thank you.
it's not ready?
under your rolling pin.
I think this is a cake knife.
this isn't a knife.
it's a fork.
I don't know.
it's such a small kitchen.
careful of the cord.
no, you didn't .
almost.
is the tea ready?
alright.
thank you, Adam.
I'll let it cool.
what do you do with a water hydrant?
oh, you don't have a small kitchen, you have a big kitchen.
no, I don't think so.
so what?
under the sofa.
why does your water come from the hydrant there?
what did you put in the trash can?
my goodness.
what kind of cup was that that you could put it in the trash can?
that's Daddy?
oh?
what kind of cake do you have, Adam?
buddy cakes?
what kind of cakes are those?
and what?
and smelly?
what?
here are two.
I see another one.
don't you see it?
over near your roller.
I'd like to know what kind of cake you're going to make here.
a dog cake.
I've never had any dog cake.
dog cake and picnic cake?
a dog cake must be a cake for a dog.
is that right?
Bozo is getting some supper for his meal for the chickens?
oh?
oh?
you're going out to the farm to get some eggs?
he did what?
he threw the egg at you and washed it?
oh, and the chicken caught it.
and gave it to Bobof to eat.
well, she's in the kitchen.
am I in your other kitchen?
alright.
oh, you want me to move?
I don't think it's broken, I think it just came out.
what?
no, it didn't break, did it?
those two are just alike.
well, how will the light keep Paul from waking up?
from waking up, yes.
that's from Pinocchio.
ok.
how long will it grow?
sixty dollars?
oh, you told the carpenter you had a big burp?
yes, it is.
what did the carpenter say?
you didn't understand what he said?
what did he say?
and what did he say?
you were talking to the door that?
you were telling the door that?
what else?
awoh.
you had an accident.
yes, you did.
I think you broke it.
well no, that's not yours, that Ursula's .
so what will you have to do?
you can throw it away if you want to.
I guess it's because you weren't playing with it gently enough.
mmhm?
be careful.
I may?
which way it were?
yes, that's right.
you did?
yes.
I think he's all finished by now.
I don't know.
perhaps he's finished too.
did he take his pencil sharpener?
whose pencil sharpener was that?
no.
I think perhaps he was going to put it up down there, wasn't he?
you did?
did you pick the screws up?
what does that roll like?
no, you have to turn it.
does it what?
not without breaking.
yes, you had an accident.
they're all clean?
Adam, did you open this package?
you opened it by yourself, didn't you?
alright.
would you like a pen?
a red one.
yes.
no, it's a red one.
yes, I did.
I ate my supper all up.
oh yes.
what does that look like?
careful.
I don't think it's lunch time, is it?
what makes you think it's lunch time?
why do you think it's lunch time?
why do you think it's lunch time?
how do you know?
how do you know that it's lunch time?
what statue told you?
I know when it's dinner time because I can tell time but how do
no, you cannot.
no.
I don't believe it.
there's nothing in this hand?
nothing in that hand either.
oh, you better put that back in there.
you go put that right back.
magician, yes.
no, he doesn't have one, does he?
be very careful.
your Daddy is going to get after you.
for taking this out.
from the baseball player, yes.
how can he play?
how can he play without a bat?
no no.
be careful, Adam.
it what?
what are you?
what kind of monster?
a sea green monster.
I'm a monster now.
what kind of monster are you?
a what?
a mompsyc?
what's a mompsyc?
no, I don't have any more.
who did use them all?
oh.
a boy what?
the light's green.
let's go now.
stop.
that's part of my body?
oh, what part is that?
just a minute, I need a pen from my purse.
I like to use a pen, don't you?
I have some things.
did you watch Captain Bob?
does he give you lessons?
what's a chicken?
he did!
alright.
how do you know she has any toys?
how do you know she has any toys?
it does.
because there was something on there.
there is one on.
alright.
I don't know.
what do you think it might have in it?
yes, oil and perhaps gas.
I suppose you can.
well, here it is, a picture of it.
yes, just like it.
perhaps if you put them as they were then they would all fit in.
is it an old truck?
no, I don't think it's an old truck.
no, I think that's the way they made it in the factory.
I don't know.
I suppose you can have in there whatever you'd like to have.
what would you like to have in there?
because it's a little truck.
that one can't be a bigger truck but there are bigger trucks.
why're you finished playing with it?
you're going to do what?
you're going to put it in with the lumber?
he's going to get prepared?
prepared to do what?
oh, are you the man?
oh, who's the man?
are you finished?
well, you just started playing with it.
I don't know.
are you finished?
I don't got nose bleed.
you lost what?
why don't you leave it on the floor?
better prepared.
it's a what?
hmm?
what is that?
anything carrying what?
he got some space.
some space for what?
you used to have little trains and you used to have one of those
there's one of the cars over there.
yes.
I really don't know that.
I think they must unscrew something and attach the hoses to the fire
we'll have to see some day.
oh no, we can't turn it on.
the firemen only can do that.
no.
because you're a little boy and I'm a lady.
we aren't men.
we can pretend, yes.
yes, we can pretend.
that's not a train.
that's a car carrier.
it carries cars from one place to another.
especially new cars.
it gets new cars from the factory and takes them to the place where
mmhm.
and Ramblers.
do you know any other kind of car?
other than a Rambler?
what kind do you know?
that's all?
the people at the factory who made the car painted it.
where are you supposed to park them?
you didn't put the gas tanks back on that truck.
oh, do you have a garage?
well, what're you going to do with these?
here, the tanks.
you're going to do what?
perhaps she doesn't have any more.
did you ever think of that?
no?
yes, they are tiny, aren't they?
I don't know.
poor Robin gets blamed for everything.
is that like the one in your book?
oh, Adam, that's not fair.
you just started playing with that.
is put the whole bag down here.
that's a bouncing ball.
you try and hit it with the paddle.
do you want to blow?
blow again.
blow one more time.
mmhm.
you're finished?
alright.
I don't know why.
yes, that's fine.
here's the bag on the floor.
see what?
do I see it rolling?
it's alright to leave the bag on the floor.
she has no more toys.
what?
do you want to blow?
what takes the car?
the car carrier.
what does a truck carrier carry?
no, you can't keep this.
see, you're supposed to try to hit the ball with the paddle in your
yes, you hit it.
pull it out like this so the ball goes up in the air.
yes.
yes.
where does the truck run?
where does the truck run?
to be prepared for what?
oh, which street?
I don't know.
why don't they go down Massachusetts Avenue?
and then what town will they go to?
so the man can see and not have a bump?
oh, they should have a bump.
why should they?
he can see the Rambler at dark_timec?
the what?
oh, the lumber.
my goodness, that car sure is pulling something big.
the cab.
the cab.
pulling the trailer.
he can't pull both of them, can he?
I don't know.
where are you going?
what kind of work are they going to do?
derrick work?
yes.
yes.
they should turn right.
yes.
mmhm.
yes.
yes.
they should turn right.
yes.
mmhm.
no, left.
mmhm.
I think they should keep going down Broadway street.
I guess the hitch is broken.
why?
because you need to have your nose wiped.
no.
because we need to use them.
no, there are no more.
that's the top.
the part that you open so that you can pull the kleenex up through
what?
because you put it on there.
he has a new little big trailer.
they don't burn it down.
oh mmhm.
can what?
you mean can a building burn down by itself?
yes, if someone starts a fire.
or if a fire is started in a building and the firemen don't come.
to put the fire out.
then the building burns down.
and who puts it back up?
no.
they don't build buildings.
I don't believe that.
how did they put it back up?
they put the fire out.
who?
yes, when they put the fire out.
to put another fire out.
putting the fire out at the school.
yes they put the fire out at the school, didn't they?
and then we saw the derricks tearing the school down.
yes.
because they didn't want the school to burn all the way down.
the hitch wasn't on properly.
yes, but you can only put one car in there now.
because it's in too far.
no.
I don't know.
what do you think?
do you think it's a doctor?
could be a doctor?
that's right.
can you put it back together?
where's the rest of the train?
no.
I don't know.
did you?
no, that was Daddy.
I guess so.
is that the caboose?
no?
how can you tell which one is the caboose?
yes, it is very very crowded.
you don't ?
why not?
oh, that's very kind of you.
mmhm.
somebody was laughing.
who was laughing?
a witch, you thought.
oh, I know that.
you just kid me all the time.
yes, you do.
yes.
yes, he's sleeping.
what?
he's sleeping down in his bed.
good.
no, I don't .
turn your paddle over.
good.
see if you can hit it again.
did you tell Ursula about your new doctor?
he did?
did he give it to you in your arm?
what?
no.
but you may be a doctor when you grow up if you'd like to.
oh yes, I think doctors enjoy being doctors.
what did you have in his office?
yes, he gave you a lollipop.
what color?
no, it was green.
yes, you have lips.
God.
you were born with lips.
no.
well, everybody has lips.
oh, that's a beard?
a what?
you mean a stethoscope.
like a doctor has.
let's see if I hear something.
what do you hear?
hear a what?
try to get your room straightened out.
you took them all down.
you did.
what makes you think she brought any toys?
yes, you made a big mistake.
you took what off?
no no no, don't crawl in there.
thank you.
put the wheels on the train.
alright.
except you are sliding in my trash.
here's another one.
oh my goodness.
and he gave his mother his milk.
are you a carpenter?
why do you do that sometimes?
what?
the mixer?
I don't know.
just a minute, please.
well, not in my trash, please, thank you.
no, you don't put your things all over the floor.
what is that you have now?
what kind of machine is that?
oh, the dirt dumps it in the pail?
yes.
yes.
oh, I see.
two trailers and one is behind the other one?
who was crying last night?
what do you think there is?
it's what?
what do you think it is?
what else?
oh yes.
pull it.
no?
here's a little hole.
why not open it from there?
open the whole thing.
what do you think it is?
what?
it's medicine.
yes, if she's sick.
yes.
it's a cough drop.
what is that?
no.
it's a microscope.
open the whole thing.
oh, you're opening the whole thing?
what is that?
why don't you read the directions first?
oh, you read it through the paper?
who is that?
don't you have a book about him?
what is that?
no, that's a popper.
a needle.
you know, like the one Dr Sherry gave you.
what do you think?
yes.
stethoscope.
hmm?
that's a microscope.
it's a microscope.
well, I don't think you're really supposed to put it down so far.
look through that little hole in the microscope.
can you look through there?
these are germs.
dirty water germs.
these are germs from dirty hands.
these are fingernail germs.
those are germs from dirty faces.
germs from dirty ears.
like a what?
I don't know.
why don't you put that in the doctor's kit.
that's a bag for going to call on people.
you can pretend to be a doctor.
oh, you left your germs out.
hmm?
are you done?
hmm?
Adam, you didn't put your cough drops in.
another what?
hmm?
sleep away?
what do you mean?
you'd like to do what?
obey?
obey whom?
oh?
do you want to listen to my heartbeat?
huh?
so closer?
aspirin?
hmm?
oh, you don't take my temperature that way.
you just take little children's temperature that way.
I take my temperature in my mouth.
did you ask Ursula?
you may have it if she says so.
well, you have it.
is he singing?
oh, he's thinking?
we'll let Adam examine you, like to check on Paul?
are you his doctor?
I'll pretend.
here comes Dr Adam.
he didn't even cry, did he?
he didn't even cry.
oh, you mustn't touch the doctor's bag.
examine Paul?
oh, is something wrong with him?
what is it?
oh, and that will make him stop waking up and crying?
listen to his back.
this is for checking very closely, this is a check to whether the
it's so small I can't even see it.
it came from the box, I think.
here are some signs for the office.
for your office.
this really goes under here.
you put it on there and you look through the hole.
can you see?
read what it says and you can see all of these germs.
the germs from the hands?
these are the germs from dirty hands down here.
surprise?
alright.
it what?
those are cherries, Adam.
which germs?
those are germs from dirty faces.
and here we have the germs from dirty.
what's the word?
dirty ears.
here we have germs from dirty faces
will I smile about it when I laugh?
what do you mean?
he's got your germs, Adam.
he's got your germ list.
you come back here.
he just wants to know about germs too.
well.
maybe he wants to be a doctor.
so he can help make people well.
yes, he's really just a baby.
he can't be a doctor while he's a baby.
he can just pretend.
like you can pretend.
like you can just pretend.
yes, you can pretend.
hmm?
well, because he's just a little baby and he doesn't know how to
well, because he's a little baby.
and he doesn't think like you do.
he's not as big as you.
because that's something that hasn't developed.
you're talking very quietly?
why?
no?
no no, Adam.
no no, Adam.
well, because he's just a little baby and he doesn't need to eat
you liked it, didn't you?
he likes it but it's not particularly good for him.
no, he doesn't need to taste it.
you tell him how it tastes.
and a what?
become a spider?
who is going to become a spider?
a spider what?
I don't know.
I thought you said something about become a spider.
oh.
there's a little boy over there who is sick who needs to be
in your bowling ball box.
he doesn't want to play.
so he must not feel well.
hello, Doctor Adam.
will you come to my house and check my little boy?
that's for checking the paper for seeing about dirty germs on your
is he alright?
well, what was wrong with him?
did he have a fever?
did he have a fever or a cold?
did he have pneumonia?
oh, he just had a little cold.
here's your money, Doctor.
thank you very much.

I thought I only had to pay ten dollars.
how much do I have to pay?
some checks.
alright.
well, here's a check.
no.
you don't need any money.
no.
I just gave you some money, Doctor.
don't you see that money?
go get two pennies out then.
no, just two.
one two.
just two.
how many did you get out?
let's see how much you have.
no, Paul can't have pennies.
well, you keep three pennies and put the nickel back in.
here, you may keep three pennies.
put the nickel back.
put it back in the drawer.
alright, now you have five pennies.
Paul's going to be the doctor.
alright.
yes.
mmhm.

oh.
oh.
alright.
he can play with that one.

I don't believe I've ever seen that.
is that a new toy?
by Marx?
Paul, you come back over here.
you're just getting in your brother's way.
Adam's going to give you the block, Paul.
he's going to be a nurse and you're going to be a doctor?
ok.
oh.
what am I going to be?
where is Hans?
why don't you go get Hans and examine him?
examine.
alright.
is he alright?
got what?
alright.
you're the doctor.
you've examined Hans and he's alright?
well, my patient is alright too.
my patient is alright.
don't cry, Paul.
it'll be alright.
thank you.
what?
just as long as I'm holding him.
not by himself.
oh, will I?
what are you?
yes, it is.
it was even made by Indians.
that's right.
so children can dress up to look like Indians.
what?
yes.
yes.
what do you think they are?
they're not Santa Claus.
when you give Christmas presents you write the name of the person too
let me see it.
Santa Claus?
what does he have in his hand?
on his legs?
what are those?
mmhm.
sled?
oh, I don't know.
maybe he parked it some place.
he's going around looking to see if he can find some good little
Adam, you didn't ask Ursula if you could open that.
I hope so.
his name is Jocko.
Jocko.
he looks like a monkey.
it's a puzzle you know.
here are some more.
these come out too.
I see it.
why don't we take this up and you look and see if that's right.
see if those are in the right place.
what do you think goes there?
that's right.
now push it back.
no, that's not.
so that must not be right.
where do you think that goes?
close your eyes.
now look at it and see if you can find where it goes.
is that the shape?
that must be what?
do you see one that might look like a half moon?
I see it.
yes.
well, is that the way it goes?
yes, but it must not be the right way.
that's better.
I don't think that looks like a nose to me.
what do you think it looks like?
a heater?
what kind of heater?
a race?
what kind of race?
what does it look now?
yes.
my, doesn't it look like lots of things.
whatever it is there must be two.
those two look just alike.
one must go on one side of the head and one must go on the other
what do you think they are?
mmhm.
mmhm.
apple?
alright.
oh, I wonder what this is.
there are two of those too.
I see two shapes that look just like that.
on the puzzle.
a camera?
you put it where you think it goes.
alright.
I don't see it, do you?
alright.
alright.
I don't see it.
oh.
alright.
is that where it goes?
here's something we didn't take out.
these pieces?
oh, you want me to put all of mine in?
yes.
a little girl with a pinafore.
a little girl with a dress.
Jocko.
a monkey.
no.
I don't know.
yes, it looks like a wiggleworm but it's not a wiggleworm, is
I don't know.
could that be his tail?
he doesn't have feet like that, does he?
maybe that's a vine growing on the tree.
maybe that's a vine growing on the tree.
let's finish this first.
that's his tongue, isn't it?
the reindeer pulls his sleigh.
yes, perhaps he's parked them.
maybe he's parked all the others and he's just taking that one with
that's the, um
bottom of his boat.
well, that's his suit that he wears to keep him warm and that's
you may ask Ursula.
yes, they do.
Jocko.
I don't know.
poor Jocko.
he doesn't have a nose.
oh, he has a nose now.
he said thank you for the mouth.
not in that ear.
thank you.
yes, thank you.
I don't know.
where do you think it goes?
he's got his nose.
I don't know.
no, it came from this.
you must have broken it.
you probably stepped on it.
yes, that you step on.
what?
what?
that's right.
I think you did.
I think so.
yes.
yes.
it was an accident.
yes, it is.
no, not at all.
he doesn't understand.
he's too little to understand.
hmm?
I don't think you have to cut it.
maybe you can color it?
I don't think you need to color that.
it's fun?
I don't think.
another Ursula?
no no, Adam.
careful.
ok, I'm just going to turn him around and I'll come back.
oh, why did you put those in your doctor kit?
kit or box.
mmhm.
you lost some germs from dirty hands.
I don't know.
aren't they in there?
did you tell Ursula what we did yesterday?
don't you remember?
where did we go?
outside.
and what did we do outside?
not really, we just bought a loaf of bread and some eggs.
where did we go?
no, you don't need to cut them.
no, he lost his face, Adam.
what did the story say about sharing last night, Adam?
sharing toys?
with your brother.
oh no.
he wants you to play with that.
no, not if he's careful.
that might break.
this part looks like it's had an accident.
this is a bucket loader.
he what?
like a mitten.
did you put your puzzle back together, Adam?
Jocko?
show Paul how it goes.
Paul has never seen his face.
Jocko's face.
put it together and then show Paul.
he'll like that.
that's alright.
let's play over here.
ok?
no, honey.
let's put Jocko together.
and then we'll look at some books.
maybe Ursula brought some of Robin's books.
let's put the puzzle together and pick it up first.
oh, he only has half of his ear.
now he has two ears but no face.
right into a lobster!
where's a lobster?
Paul, Adam is putting Jocko together.
then we can look at some of Robin's books.
no no.
what did Daddy say about throwing that ball, Adam?
no, he said he wanted to find the ball right where he put it.
mmhm.
you hit Daddy with the ball and he told you to leave it up there.
hmm?
why are you taking him apart?
ok.
what, sweetie?
there it is over there.
yes, he needs an ear.
he needs two ears so he can hear what you're saying and a nose for
he can't talk yet, he doesn't have a mouth.
he can't see you because he doesn't have what?
I don't know.
guess you must have lost his eyes?
no?
where are they?
I don't see them.
mmhm.
mmhm.
you didn't need your scissors, did you?
there they are.
you didn't tell Ursula yet where you went yesterday.
we rode in a taxi and you sat in a chair.
where were you?
can you tell her about your visit to the dentist?
is that your first time?
yes.
what did the dentist say to you?
what did she tell you?
that you had no what?
no cavities.
you don't have any cavities at all, do you?
that's very good.
yes.
yes.
this is one of Robin's favorites.
what do you think it might be?
what is that?
isn't that a funny book?
what was that?
butterfly.
and what lives in there?
what lives in that house?
you have to ask Ursula.
airplanes.
yes, she said it was an airplane.
that page is gone.
just open the flap and you will see.
that's a rhinoceros.
were you coming to me?
what is your problem?
Paul would you like to see the book?
seals and fish.
when you step on things you break them.
no.
let's see if it still stands up.
what are those?
yes.
yes.
what does he sell?
what does he sell?
icecream for boys and girls.
alright.
no, I don't think that's a hippopotamus.
isn't that a rhinoceros?
why don't you look at another one?
my goodness.
you're a donkey?
you're a donkey pulling a wagon.
where're you going with the wagon?
what?
because I'm going to put the door on.
oh, Joe.
French Joe.
I hope it doesn't come out.
so they willn't fall out.
that's lumber?
I don't know.
let's see.
that backs the dirt out?
oh, it doesn't go there?
where does it go?
no.
well, I just picked it up off the floor.
right.
are they all named Joe?
huh?
that's what what?
oh, it does?
in that little tiny hole?
oh, what happens after it goes down there?
what?
box?
each other?
thank you.
not very well.
for seeing?
Ursula.
no, I think that was before the games.
careful.
well, give it to her.
you have to look and see.
can you open the bag?
what is he doing?
no no no.
you don't do that.
you have to turn it.
oh yes, if you put it down.
he's walking, isn't he?
ask Ursula what his name is.
he doesn't have one yet.
we have to ask permission first.
now you blow through the hole.
try it.
there.
see?
no.
for the bubbles to go in there?
I don't think they'll go in there.
did she put that there or did you do it?
what happened to it?
blow very gently.
blow gently.
that's right.
what happens when you catch them?
blow gently.
if you blow gently I think you'll get more.
don't put it in your mouth.
why don't you hold it?
I don't know.
I didn't see you.
did you?
if you want to.
now, what if you blow them up in the air?
no, it didn't go there.
blow it up in the air.
he can see.
don't put it in your mouth, honey.
because it was so pretty.
no no, Adam.
don't put it in your mouth, honey.
Adam, we'll have to put it up if you put it in your mouth again.
it doesn't taste good, does it.
Paul sees that one.
blow gently, Adam.
see.
it's all gone.
do you have it?
let's see.
no, Adam, we can't play with it any more if you're going to
no, you put it in your mouth.
here's one over here.
gift.
what kind of gift?
no no.
what's happening?
look at his feet.
slippers.
so his feet willn't get cold.
you can use that ball for bowling.
those are all the same colors.
what?
is the ball you were speaking of in the box with the bowling pin?
well, go see if it looks like that.
because he likes to.
why would you do that?
oh, but he's very talented.
he can play two.
oh, you made a mistake?
how did you lose yourself?
why do you say Ursula's words?
what's that?
oh yes, I see.
are they turning?
bowling pins.
what color?
what color is that?
no, this is blue.
is there a blue one?
what color is that ball in your hand?
green.
yes, I'll bowl with you.
yes, we knocked them all down.
because that's the way to play the game.
you have to turn it around so that it matches.
look at all of your and see if you have one that matches.
no, that has four.
would it fit anywhere else?
no.
you put one out first.
you have to match it.
why don't you make what you want, and I'll make what I want.
hmm?
it is?
I don't know.
what is it going to carry?
what?
I think that's nice that you're not crying.
amen.
I was thinking of a funny story.
did you tell her about your visit to the pet shop?
what did you see at the pet shop, Adam?
puppies.
he's giving them names.
only it didn't have a mask over his eyes.
yes, you're silly.
yes, silly billywp, willywp, dillywp.
what is your name?
did you see turtles?
at the pet shop.
what else did you see?
fish?
and what else?
no, you saw something else.
something in cages.
and what else?
yes.
I don't think so.
well, nothing might happen.
I just didn't think you'd like to have a kitty.
what are you singing about?
ok.
they willn't fall out.
because the door isn't wide enough.
no, I said wide enough but big enough is the same.
you ate the snake up?
was he good?
oh, in the bunkhouse.
what did you do?
yes, turtles crawl.
yes, snakes crawl.
I guess they walk, yes.
I really don't know, Adam, if you want to be so specific.
I think so.
that's something from last time.
when you were playing upstairs.
I don't remember, what was in it.
why don't you let one of the Joes drive.
is this Joe?
oh, this is terrific.
Joe terrific.
and the other one he says is just Joe.
perhaps the other Joe would be a better driver.
he was in your truck.
I don't know.
could he sit beside him?
he can ride in something else.
it's a what?
yeah.
was that another one getting some fire?
red street light.
you have to stop.
green light, you may go.
yes.
bring the can up to here.
the whole thing.
blow gently now.
no no Adam.
don't put it in your mouth, dear.
it's not to eat.
what do you think it is?
what does it look like to you?
can't you tell the truth?
what does it taste like?
what do banjos taste like?
no, those are bowling pins.
for what?
no, nothing goes in there.
those are bowling pins.
so who can see it?
no, I don't need to see it.
I know what it looked like.
no, Adam.
we have to put it up.
no, you don't need to play with the can right now.
why do you want to put it in your mouth?
very good.
oh my goodness.
where're the firemen?
oh, he did.
oh, very good.
now what happens?
a house?
yes, I think so.
he'd like to get down on the floor and knock all your toys down.
isn't that right, Paul?
stop that, Paul.
oh my goodness.
there are lots of houses.
how many do you have?
oh yes, I see.
where're they going?
oh.
oh.
get what?
oh, that's a nice little door.
ok.
do they live with each other or next to each other?
they've got what?
ladies?
at their homes?
oh, they're going in?
who's there?
fireman who?
oh, I don't want you to knock because you might burn my house down.
oh alright.
come in.
oh, that was a fireman's boy?
no, they're going to put the fire out so that it willn't burn the
well, they weren't built very well so they have be built again.
oh, they're going to build them this time.
when the ladder gets up there?
they have to get a ladder to build a house?
a chimney?
for their aunts?
oh yes.
oh, it's closed?
oh, very good.
I think that's very nice of them.
Paul, are you going to sleep in the bed because you're tired?
oh yes, he is.
he just woke up and had his bath and his breakfast and then he played.
so he's tired.
yes.
he's so tiny that he doesn't really know that it's not nice to knock
he just thinks it's fun to get the toys.
did you tell Ursula where we went yesterday?
you know where we went yesterday.
I'm not going to tell you.
you tell me.
where did you go, Adam?
is that the truth, Adam?
I don't believe that's the truth.
don't you remember where we went and what we saw?
a Dick Tracy car.
what else did we see?
where were you, Adam?
can you tell her what else you saw?
now that it's all fixed what else did you see?
we walked and Paul was in the stroller.
he can't walk.
he's too heavy for Mommy to carry.
I'm not going to tell you but I know.
I'm not going to tell you.
I know.
what I saw yesterday.
I'm not going to tell you because you saw it too.
well, tell us, what did you see?
well, we walked all that way just to see a Dick Tracy car and
and what else, Adam?
that's all!
Paul saw some nice things.
I don't know.
you don't seem to remember.
Paul, what did you see?
we went to the Boston Common.
careful, careful, careful.
it's my coat.
it is not.
is there a lady like that at nursery school?
there must be a lady with a jumper on at nursery school.
what's her name?
you can't tell the truth.
you're jumping rope.
did you finish moving your furniture?
you have a cough, don't you, Adam?
yes.
what do you think the Doctor does when he's sick?
did you check yourself?
you did?
are you making a train?
yes.
yes.
what?
you do.
what about one of these pens?
alright.
no, you can't write on those.
I'll give you some paper.
oh, can you do that?
no, she doesn't want to listen to a record.
here's some paper.
what does it say?
Adam, will you have swordfish tonight?
he had some yesterday.
oh, thank you.
what shall I write?
here's something to write on.
where did you put your pen?
what?
he said it's not.
do that again.
I don't think there is an eraser on that.
he has a long head like a string?
that looks just like a wiggleworm.
yes, it does look like a bear.
how many eyes?
four eyes and what?
and one half?
with a big wiggle?
oh?
that's nice.
what is it now?
a broom?
do you sweep?
a wolf?
yes, I guess that looks like a wolf.
it looks like a wolf.
there are his ears and there's his nose.
nothing.
see?
oh?
a swordfish.
a whale?
what kind of a whale is that?
oh, it's a baby whale.
yes, Cinderella.
that's part of that one.
they're both in the same block.
who is that?
Rumplestiltskin.
Little_Red_Hen.
where's Ducky_Lucky?
no, Ducky_Lucky's over there.
Chicken_Licken.
no, that's the ugly duckling who turned out to be what?
not an ugly duckling at all.
but what?
don't you remember?
a beautiful
what?
corn?
no.
the ugly duckling turned out to be a beautiful white
swan.
what did he find on his head?
no, that's where the acorn hit him and he went to tell the king.
what do you think?
guess.
who is Pokey_Wokey?
I don't know that story.
I don't know.
but who is that?
oh, Pinocchio.
guess.
you didn't guess.
you guess.
no.
you want another guess?
that's Rumplestiltskin right there.
no, draw on the paper.
what is that?
I don't know.
what do you think?
oh, a mail bag.
for the postman?
you do?
no, what did you make?
a train?
oh, that's a nice train.
except what?
the conductor is on the other train?
well, what is that on the back of the train?
a log truck?
here it is.
here's a piece of paper for you to draw on.
alright.
I don't know.
I wrote it down there.
can you read it?
yes, you wrote it too.
so you should be able to read it.
two fish?
why do we need two fish?
got sick?
some flowers.
did he say no thank you?
no.
he said thank you for the flowers.
don't tear it.
oh, that's nice isn't it?
ask your Mother, Adam.
yes.
you guess what it is.
well, I guess you can just pull the paper.
that was a big pop.
what do you think it's for?
Adam, I think you do it on the other side.
you can?
what is that?
oh, that's nice.
are what?
lions.
the other what?
at the other end.
turn it over.
use that on the other side.
that's what you call chalk.
no, not for putting in the mouth.
no, not Chocks chalk.
no, you use the crayon on that side.
where's the box?
yes, they are both white, aren't they?
but you don't use that on that side.
you use that on the green side.
no no no.
you either use the chalk or the crayon.
on the other side.
where's the eraser?
are you sitting on the eraser?
now do you want to wipe that off?
all of it.
and then draw some more.
no, that doesn't go in with the crayons.
oh, if you wish.
like that one?
that's not really a ship, is it?
what is that?
but you can draw a sailboat.
mmhm.
what?
mmhm.
no the other way, that's right.
just like you use the crayons.
what're you looking for, Adam?
you what?
you were just joking?
you can hang it up on your wall?
you can keep it.
that's for you.
yes, that's part of it.
if you look down at the bottom of the bag there's something there
this is for Paul she said.
I didn't hear you ask her if you could open that.
yes.
goodness, what do you think those are?
wheels?
oh, what do they go on?
so you can tick it?
I don't hear it ticking.
I don't know.
you'll have to figure it all out by yourself.
isn't that fun?
well, why don't you see what you need for it first.
that's a dairy.
that's the dairy.
no, that.
what is that?
I can't read them right now.
could I see it?
you need to put the wheels under both holes.
on the other side too.
the other side now.
yes.
put it in the hole.
this isn't a doggie.
mmhm.
why?
there's another truck.
yes, you missed it.
yes, just like the other ones.
now you have to lead the trucks.
all those little things there.
well, I don't know.
what do you think they might be?
hmm?
boxes of what?
they seem to, don't they?
well, that's not really a clock, is it?
just the dairy products around here.
see the eggs the milk the butter.
I guess you could read that and it will tell you what those things
he said I want that.
I don't know.
he sees something back there that he would like to have.
you don't have any milk on that truck.
the truck you're driving.
yes, they seem to, don't they?
I don't know.
you find out.
that's right.
now, why don't you put some butter on the truck?
what about some milk?
yes, that's milk.
I'd like four quarts of milk.
now, how're you going to put it on there like that?
four quarts of milk and two pounds of butter.
ok, Mr Milkman.
I'm waiting for my four quarts of milk and my two pounds of butter
and if you can't bring it I'll just have to get another milkman.
no, you don't have what I ordered.
I said four quarts of milk.
where's the milk?
do you have four of those?
no, you don't , do you?
how do you think they go on the truck so they willn't tip over.
they might spill like that.
yes, I think I'm going to have to get another milkman.
I don't want any butter that might fall off the truck.
but you don't have what I asked for.
you've got the two dozen eggs on properly.
no, those are eggs.
they're on properly.
they willn't fall off and break.
I like to bake cakes and cookies and I need butter.
and I like to have toast and butter for breakfast.
well, you don't need to bring me any toast, Mr Milkman.
just my two pounds of butter.
I don't know, Mr Milkman.
I might have to get another milkman.
yes, see.
you lost my butter on the street.
what did you say, Adam?
where're you going to put my butter?
perhaps it would stand up too.
the other way.
I think over.
yes.
now what about loading the other truck?
yes.
oh, that's not nice.
I need lots of milk, Adam.
no, I think that milkman might be alright now.
I guess he was new at the job.
no.
would you close the door, please?
freedom.
oh, now I know where this goes.
does this go here?
oh, why would you do that?
why don't you put the extra butter and eggs on here.
well, why don't you pick those up off the floor first and put those
you're sitting on a quart of milk.
oh, I don't think you meant to.
a pound of butter and a dozen eggs over there.
mmhm.
now, do you know what these are?
these are houses.
people who want milk and butter and eggs.
I'd like one quart of milk.
and a dozen eggs.
one dozen eggs.
alright, thank you, Mr Milkman.
goodbye.
hello.
I'd like three quarts of milk, please.
mmhm.
there's a quart of milk.
mmhm.
what?
two pounds of butter.
guess.
that's where you keep your milk.
I'd like two quarts of milk, please.
two quarts of milk.
hmm?
perhaps so.
no, I don't think that's a sailboat.
where's the boat and where's the sail?
what?
does it ship?
what do you mean?
not really, he's just trying to use me for a ladder.
don't put your tongue out like a snake.
yes, that's what Paul did.
do you remember what Paul calls you?
what does he call you?
no.
no, what does he call you?
no, what does he call you?
doesn't he call you his brother?
hmm?
how many quarts?
oh, milk truck.
be careful.
you almost did.
your nose what?
blown?
alright, go get a Kleenex.

no no, Paul.
oh, you're shoveling the snow off?
yes.
careful, Adam.
don't hit Paul on the head.
do what?
oh no, don't hit him with that.
that might hurt him.
oh, that wasn't very kind to do.
he's too big to jump through that hole, don't you think?
I'm too big to jump through that hole.
no, you're too big.
the hole is too small.
did you go to school this morning, Adam?
yeah.
yes?
one more.
hhmm?
did you turn it over?

I don't know about that.
don't you turn it around?
no.
no.
no.
why is it easier to do it that way?
oh?
that's alright.
I almost sat on Paul, he moves so quickly.
you're not big enough to play the game, Adam says.
oh, he'll play a game with some blocks.

dot dot.
do you remember what you told Mommy about this?
you said it was an al upsidedown.
no, that's properly.
but it wasn't an al at all, was it?
it was a vl.
you're not big enough to play the game yet, ok?
he thinks he's grown a little.
hhmm?
because they're just babies.
what're you going to do with that, Paul?
I see it.
mhm.
well, I'm sorry, Paul.
you'll have to grow a little.
yes.
no, I put that there for you.
you might be able to see what you write better if you use that.
I don't understand why you want that.
oh, he's grown enough?
yeah.
ok.
I'll play over here with him so he willn't bother you.
ok.
well, come on.

Adam, what about your board over here?
how are you doing with it?
I ready.
no, I don't think so.
this morning?
yes.
he didn't play with anything this morning.
he went to sleep this morning.
this morning?
he was playing with the cow.
Adam, no no, not in his face.
she turned the direction so she could hear better.
careful, don't push him down, honey.
Paul, why don't you come over here.
Adam, can you spell your name over here?
look here.
Adam.
can you put these letter on here?
I can't make those hl.
you don't have to make it.
I mean with these.
mhm.
let him look at one.
here, Paul.
what is this, Adam?
a channel.
no, he does not.

about a funny dog.
yes.
yes.
they were shooting at him and the in the stall was what?
wolf.
no, a big bull.
and the dog got frightened of the big bull and backed out.
bull?
yes.
no, I don't think he'd like you in there either.
yes.
careful, Adam.
you're heavier than Paul.
you might hurt him.
what else happened?
do you remember the name of the story?
yes.
what was it?
a funny cartoon.
it's about Hector.
the stowaway pup.
yes, it was.
why are you doing that?
is that the way you dash away?
no, Paul.
what are you eating?
apples.
why are you eating an apple?
do you know why?
why?
I don't know why.

mine says pl al ul ll.
what does that spell?
me said tl vl el il ll.
what does that spell?
pl ul il ml ol.
this is Paul's name.

let's see if I can find enough letters to spell your name.

that's your name.
ok.
hhmm?
whose glove is that?
yeah.
that's Ursula's glove.
you have pretty gloves?
yeah.
who said your gloves were pretty?

this is another word, Adam.
that's hl el he.
here's another word.
her.
here's another word, Adam, look.
Paul, you come over and play with this.
that's for big boys Adam said.
what is that?
hl.
a snail?
yes.
what does a snail do?
I think that's the number six.
no, this is channel two.
this is two.
where is four?
what do you mean?
poor Paul.
you're having a hard time.
thank you.
that's alright.
he can play with a few.
yes, maybe he's big enough now.
how is what?
dat.
oh, why don't you go get some?
dey right here.
what do you mean channel four stops on two.
why are you hiding behind there? four goes here.
what goes next?
channel ol goes next.
what is that?
tl.
that's kl.
Mrs Bekaer.
well, kl starts with key, yes.
no, they have to be like that.
what does vl sound like?
dl.
do you know what that sounds like?
Adam, will you say one two three four?
you say it.
oh yes.
that's alright.
something's sticking out on the tape recorder?
what do you think it is?
do you have a Harvard shirt on?
what?
oh, the dresser is hurting your head.
why are you putting your head on the dresser?
does it still hurt you?
it what?
Adam, maybe you can use these.
you have some?
where?
what colors do you have?
red and blue?
anything else?
hmm?
well, it'd be nicer to leave the box there and just take them out.
if you leave the box there then we'll know where it is.
alright.
would you get your handkerchief, please?
what did you see on television last night?
did it have a lion in it?
did it have a scarecrow in it?
did it have a wizard in it?
that's right.
can you?
I don't think so.
it's glued on there, isn't it?
do you know why those people wanted to go see the wizard?
you don't know?
you don't know why?
they each wanted the wizard to do something.
do you know what the lion wanted?
handle it very gently.
you can open one end.
yes, you open it.
now let's see.
the stick
attach rubber.
we have to attach it to this little hook.
I'm taking out the tail part.
I think you can take this piece out too.
really?
alright, Adam.
take this piece off very carefully.
these we put into here.
these are wings and we're putting them into the clip.
mmhm.
no.
this is the wing.
and another wing.
I'm taking the end off.
then they can attach by themselves.
we're putting this clip onto the stick so it will go like an.
it's not easy.
no, it's not so easy.
oh, I see it did.
now you turn the propeller many times.
ok, let's try it.
you try it.
now hold it up in the air and let go.
it's a Sky_Dart.
the same way you put it together.
oh no.
why don't you leave it together?
oh, a bit more.
a Sky_Dart.
Paul, Adam's talking to you.
do it more until it's tight.
no, it doesn't have wheels.
sometimes.
well, it's not a regular airplane.
it's what you call a Sky_Dart.
that's why the wings aren't straight.
hmm?
see, Paul.
mmhm.
thank you.
he didn't give me anything.
I took some paper from him.
I took it from him.
the tail.
the rudder.
no?
which part don't you like?
alright.
you can have it straight.
wind it many times.
that makes it fly.
that's right.
well, don't hold the rubber band.
because then you keep it from turning.
no.
no no, don't let Paul get it.
that's right.
well, he likes it but he doesn't know how to handle it carefully.
you aren't holding the rubber band, are you?
it turns too.
see how the band is being twisted?
the wings don't turn, do they?
what are those?
I thought you said that was a propeller.
no, it was right but it fell on its tail.
on a caboose?
what kind of caboose?
you need to hold it up like this.
thank you.
I guess when it hits the floor it hits so hard that it falls off.
mmhm.
I heard it.
that's the place to attach the dart to the propeller.
no?
why?
it thought your arm was a tree.
why did it think that?
you didn't hold it up high enough.
first you wind it many times
then you hold it here and here and let go.
Paul wouldn't know what to do with an airplane.
I don't think I would, Adam, because it's not very strong.
you willn't cut your finger, what?
oh yes, when it snaps.
that's a strong rubber band.
oh, did it break?
not in that, but people get in real airplanes, don't they?
it doesn't fly all by itself.
you help it by turning the propeller.
I just don't think that Paul is interested.
where?
are there any children?
oh.
you made it?
who made it?
oh, you made one.
mmhm.
a little boy named George.
and he had a sister named what?
no, Tony was the little baby.
his sister's name was what?
the little girl.
her name is Sheila.
Sheila.
careful, Adam, you may break your airplane.
mmhm.
your Sky_Dart.
the what?
you don't ?
well, are you being very very careful with it?
it fell on that, on that part, Adam.
those are bright tone crayons.
careful.
pick the one you dropped on the floor up.
what do you think that is?
they're all black?
I'm asking you.
no, they aren't all black.
yes, I think that's black.
no, the paper is.
some of the paper is black.
but that's yellow.
the yellow black thing.
I don't know why the black should be on the yellow.
all the others have their own color.
maybe they made a mistake
oh, honey.
yes, you made a mistake.
no, Adam.
careful, honey.
fell, went over you.
what are you going to do with it?
oh, Adam.
an airplane fell on your little brother.
Adam.
Adam.
did you make another mistake?
you're pushing Paul.
will you take those and put them back in the crayon box, so they
yes.
why would you want to break them?
you don't like crayons?
you think that is meat?
what kind of meat?
you made two of that, Adam?
hmm?
because you took them out.
that has two ends and evidently you opened both of them, now where
you magicked them?
where did you magic them to?
you mean you made them disappear?
who has to leave and get them?
oh, the airplane does.
alright.
you don't want it to fall.
well, I need my bricks if I have to build my building.
your hands are what?
yes.
you weren't such a magician after all, were you?
well, these are Paul's .
I'm giving these to Paul.
no no.
he has blocks too, you know.
here, Paul.
let him have one block while you build your building.
thank you.
mmhm.
this is my building over here.
I didn't knock mine down.
so I see.
no no, Paul.
you'll cut your little fingers there.
he's just a little baby.
he can't play well yet.
watch the propeller, Paul.
Paul, can you say airplane.
Paul, Adam wants to know if you can say airplane.
alright.
this is your house.
it fell apart again.
it's going to fall apart?
why?
well, because it's just a little Sky_Dart.
no, why would you take it apart?
oh?
my what?
I put the men in my house?
in the airplane.
alright.
go in the airplane.
well, he's too fat.
I don't think he can go in the airplane.
I wouldn't laugh about that.
they're too heavy.
are you ready, Adam?
no, it didn't break.
what?
now how can you fly the Sky_Dart?
well, don't break the airplane.
ok.
you can't sit on Paul, dear.
he's not quite big enough yet.
now what do I do?
one two three four.
what?
Paul, Adam says it's your turn.
you take Paul's turn because he can't do that.
I'm watching.
why do you think it does?
he what?
no, be careful, Adam.
no, you didn't .
you hit the side of the chair.
you don't throw blocks, you know.
no, you don't .
alright.
you may make them ski just two at a time.
no no, Paul.
where's your handkerchief?
oh yes.
wait a minute.
close it up.
that's right.
you can.
oh, shall I show you?
yes please.
you hold him down here and squeeze and it makes him jump.
you squeeze and then let go.
is that what he's doing?
because he's holding on by his hands.
you show me how.
what do I do?
oh, I see.
oh, he's clever isn't he?
let's call him Clever the Clown?
well, you didn't finish playing with this yet.
pull it out and see.
oh, careful.
you look like a Chinese princess.
a blonde wig.
it's a wig.
why are you backing away?
look at this, Adam.
I like this.
what do you suppose this is?
a lion!
do you think that's a lion?
look at it again.
what do you think he is?
no, that doesn't look like a lion.
yes, it looks like a leopard.
that's the way he fights.
that's the way he has to get his food.
if he's in a cage.
no, I don't think so.
yes, he may try.
it wouldn't fit me.
I'm a little too big.
you've seen people wear those, haven't you?
a what?
uniform?
what kind of uniform?
no, you're asking me.
no.
well, that's part of the dress that some people wear.
remember in your book.
I think it's Chinese.
that was an accident.
oh, come on.
put it on.
let me find a mirror so you can look at yourself.
oh, you'd like me to buy a dress like that?
that's pretty, isn't it?
a dragon.
I don't think so.
what?
there were two other ones.
so two people can play.
yes.
oh.
yes, that's almost all.
you do.
what time is it?
well, you're right.
can you tell time?
you come over here and let me see if you can tell time.
you say that's six o' clock.
what time is it now?
oh, that's three thirty five.
no, that's six thirty.
that's five minutes after five.
no, that's dinner time.
I don't think you can get it in your pocket.
you have to put it back in the bag.
be careful.
yes, it did.
it's a recorder.
recorder.
blowing cars?
what do you mean?
what do you mean?
you can move it anywhere you want.
you can change the shape.
you could wear it for a bracelet.
what?
you better put things in it?
what kind of things would you put in it?
did you show Ursula your car?
a net?
what are you catching?
what kind of fish did you catch?
thank you.
yes, I like fish.

I think I have enough fish now.

well, they have to be clean.
they don't roll?
why not?
why do you think they don't ?
alright.
I'll cook them tonight.
don't put it in there, Adam.
you may forget it.
she has to take them back home.
why don't you put it some place so that you willn't forget it.
what?
some meat?
no thank you.
we're going to have fish.
what else shall we have for supper?
beans?
peas?
and what else?
and macaroni?
anything else?
what would I like from the store?
some soup and some juice.
and some hamburger.
goodbye.
I thought that was the store over near the window.
no?
some macaroni.
thank you.
this is my refrigerator.
right here.
you can look.
Adam, why don't you show Ursula what you did yesterday?
I think it's on the other page on the back.
there.
yes.
I guess not.
yes.
it's a poodle.
it works like a puppet, Adam.
you put your hand in it.
that's right.
you were getting it right.
call somebody back?
oh?
alright.
I don't usually keep soup in my refrigerator.
I keep it in the cabinet.
oh, the shelf right there.
no, the one down here with the bus.
what kind of soup did you buy for me?
oh, thank you.
yes, that was a loud noise.
what was it?
Paul, what?
oh, did Paul say what was it?
no, I said what was it.
not better what?
no, food is better than what?
than hair?
what hair?
no, those are Bandaids.
what do you have on your neck?
absolutely nothing.
I think I need to find your suspenders, don't you think so?
you look like you're about to lose your pants.
how're you going to get it off if I put it on?
which finger?
what did you forget?
is that what he did?
did he ever remember what he forgot?
no thank you.
I don't think I need anything else from the store today.
what do I have to do right now?
what do you have to do?
what're you going to cook for supper tonight?
macaroni and beans.
and fish.
why don't you use the other part of the shelf there for a stove?
no, the other part.
yes.
how do you cook macaroni?
how do you cook it?
my pants is are going to lose.
you mean you're going to lose your pants.
I don't know.
because you wanted me to put it on your finger.
no, just one.
we have to keep those in case we have a real emergency.
you have dirt on your finger?
well, you need to put soap and water on it, not a Bandaid.
no no.
I don't think so.
do you like that?
you don't like it either?
why do you call those sunglasses?
why do you call those sunglasses?
can you?
those are Ursula's glasses.
you do too have glasses.
you have sunglasses that she gave you.
yes.
oh, with the glasses?
why do you think she looks like a raccoon with the glasses on?
around their eyes?
some puppies do.
we saw a puppy in the pet shop that had spots around his eyes.
yes, some puppies don't .
yes.
no, puppies what?
oh, Adam, don't lean on my foot.
no.
well, he's probably played with so much that it's just about to.
Adam.
did you tell Ursula why you call a scarecrow a scarecrow?
that's right.
because my hand is too large to go any further.
no, it's not.
your hand fits in there further than mine.
hello.
what?
you're getting ready to fly?
I'm not keeping you from flying.
an extension cord.
not very far in the air, did it?
yes well, that's far enough because that's not the part that.
where's the other part?
why what?
why does the other part leave?
that's the way a rocket blasts off.
like we say astronaut.
what was his name?
don't do that, please.
then what will I keep my food in?
on the shelf.
well, if I keep butter on the shelf it will melt, will it?
no.
in the bread box.
so, we'll hide it from Daddy and have a surprise?
except you always tell Daddy about the surprises, don't you?
reach what?
oops, you lost something.
let's see, that's part of the motor.
motor.
alright.
well, later perhaps.
I don't have anything to put water in right now.
can you put it back?
oh goodness.
I hope he can swim.
what?
he didn't fall out of the boot.
the boat just tipped over.
I think you can.
a space boat?
what's a space boat?
no, what was that that we watched?
I don't remember.
and where are they going?
oh, what is he doing out in the sailboat anyway?
that's not where they live?
oh, I'm glad.
maybe so.
but I don't think he rides in the boat.
he probably rides in the car.
well, perhaps just to the water's edge.
where?
part of what?
oh, that's the water?
I guess he has to let this down
perhaps he uses his oar to push out from the shore.
where's the oar?
oh, hurry up.
he lost his sail.
do you know why the boat has a sail on it?
what do you think?
why don't you try putting in?
no?
ok.
perhaps the wind blows the boat over.
oh, is that what's happening?
alright.
oh hello.
did you have a ride on your boat today.
oh, his boy went too.
is he going down in there?
I don't know.
because you didn't have it down in there properly I guess.
no no, you don't throw that, Adam.
they're on the bed, Adam.
no no, not at each other.
let's stop throwing them, Adam.
throw over on the bed where no one is sitting.
I may have how many?
what color are yours?
what color is this?
what color is this?
what color is that one in your hand?
what color is the other one?
what color is this?
what color is this?
this is black?
this is yellow.
no, you come over here and throw over there.
see if you can get your spears onto the bed.
why would you throw bugs?
bugs try to get your spear?
you put them in the back and they go what?
no no.
alright.
let's see who can get theirs on the bed.
you have to come back here.
why would you do that?
you missed.
my turn.
Adam wanted to know the other day where the sun went when night
over in your basket.
there's yours over there.
on the dresser.
good.
yours went on the bed.
let's play what again?
I wasn't looking.
what's the matter?
put Ursula's coat back up on the bed, please.
you knocked it down.
no no no.
throw on the bed, Adam.
no no, on the bed.
I threw mine on the bed.
yes, not on the bed, did you?
you did not.
careful, Adam.
Adam.
would you go get that?
let's not throw any more.
because you hurt Paul.
why would you want to do that?
why not?
don't you think it's going to be fun to have a little brother to
why would you want to hurt him?
how can you play with him if he's not in here?
Adam, now don't bother him anymore.
he went way over there to play by himself.
no, Adam.
why do you want to shoot him?
well, he willn't like to play with you if you keep doing things like
I saw, he can walk, yes.
what do you do with those little animals, Adam?
here's one.
where are the other ones?
let's go find Perro.
oh, come on.
what did you do with the animals, Adam?
it clip off?
what kind of bird is that, Adam?
what kind of bird is that?
those are rockets?
why are there so many, Adam?
over by the door?
did you look up on top of the dresser?
I didn't say that, Adam.
that's different.
why're there so many?
that's all.
it willn't stay.
we're playing a little game.
stay on top of the ball game.
just try it and see if you can get the block to stay there.
it's what?
that's a lumber company truck.
Adam, you look so tall.
did you think that?
what are you waiting for, Adam?
Adam, come and let me tie your shoes, please.
I only tied one, please.
everything is what, Adam?
no, I don't think so.
Adam, did you go to school this morning?
did you call to school this week?
yes, you did, Adam Smith.
didn't you go to school yesterday?
tell her where you went this morning.
oh, just today you got new boots.
black shoes?
and what did Paul get?
he curls his feet up so you can't get the shoes on.
Adam, where are you going?
he's learning, isn't he?
oh, Adam, what're all those things over there by your bed?
what kind of toys do you think she must have in the bag?
Adam, take out a few at a time.
oh.
oh, Adam, what is this?

what is it?
you saw one on television this morning.
in the water this morning.
no, it wasn't a whale.
seal.
no no, Adam.
no no no no.
what popped out?
I don't think anything did.
a bee might try to get the nectar from the flower, yes.
if it were real but this is a plastic flower.
it's an orchid.
perhaps if it were a real flower a bug might get in there too.
Adam, who is this?
a chatty doll.
which one, Adam?
you could.
I think one did break in Cambridge.
did, was it be a comb.
you could try it that way.
Adam, what is this?
good, Adam.
you paste them together.
you can make a bracelet with paper clips.
there's a horse for the ballerina.
what shall we do?
what do you think you could do with them, Adam?
that's a good idea.
what's a booboo clock?
he has just one baby.
no, he just likes to throw things.
flower.
do you like flowers?
I think you have just one car.
you play over her.
Adam, we forgot to bring that flag home from nursery school.
did you make one?
ballerina?
just like Captain_Kangaroo's ballerina.
that probably is your train?
no, I don't think that's your train.
it's like your train, isn't it?
I don't think you need your train.
you've got that train.
are those Fruit_loops or something like that?
it is?
just put your mouth on there a little.
don't cover the hole.
wasn't there a story about a giraffe who couldn't talk, and he
I was just doing this.
come away, Paul.
no no.
there's a heater over there and it's blowing in his face.
in the hacec?
no, I don't think they say the hacec.
I think they say the face.
I don't know.
yes.
what happened?
like a rocket?
yes.
you what?
no, what does that mean?
yesterday he said something that sounded like Tallahassee.
yesterday he said something that sounded like Tallahassee.
I think he makes up his own newscasts.
what do you say about Tallahassee?
oh, has a hassyc boy.
Adam, what's a hassyc boy.
what's a hassyc?
a genie back.
what's a genie?
what kind of statue?
Paul!
yes, he was.
about Tallahassee.
I don't think she really walks.
oh?
you didn't finish telling Ursula about the American flag that you
it's yours?
why're you going to do that?
Adam, I think Mommy broke the dolly.
broke the leg off.
no, the legs.
yes.
what're you doing, Adam?
no no, you don't bother Ursula's bag.
but you can have a pencil, Adam.
would you like some paper?
say yes please.
she can't hear your head shake.
did I put that in there?
yes.
all set.
why are you so tired?
I was trying to see if she would walk and I broke her legs.
that dolly was made in Italy.
mmhm.
what?
because they make dolls in Italy too and then they ship them to
to be sold in the stores.
no no, Paul Smith.
well, let me get him out of the way, dear.
hmm?
you had an accident.
your train fell off the track.
Jack fell down and broke his crown.
no.
you did a long long time ago.
because you're a little boy and little boys break things.
mmhm, that people bring.
I don't know.
probably why did she take my toys to that little Adam to get
it's what?
careful.
what was it doing?
oh, it's an airplane.
what is that turning?
yes, it may knock Paul.
no no, Paul.
no, he's saying I think that would be nice to eat.
it's a car horn.
it sounds like the horn is stuck.
careful, Adam.
it may pop.
you're going to take the broken doll to the shop on the airplane.
oh, you're not.
and who is he?
well, why did you give him the broken doll?
the what?
the salesman who breaks dolls.
no no, Paul, put it down.
alright.
now come over here with it, Adam.
well, you say tie this, please.
oh, that's nice.
what kind of fish did you catch?
a big fish.
oh, thank you.
what kind of big fish is it?
oh, it's a large one.
that's a small fish.
what kind of fish is that?
oh, a swordfish.
thank you.
did you catch a cowboy on your fishing rod?
oh, what kind of fish is this?
what was that breaking?
is that what it was?
oh, thank you.
what kind of fish is this?
you caught a brush?
oh, goodness.
we have enough fish for supper.
to my children.
yes.
there's a truck stuck.
gently, honey.
you might hurt his head.
you're brushing his hair like a Beatle's hair?
my husband was talking about them last night and he was brushing
Paul reminds me of the cat in Peter and the Wolf wondering if it was
no.
he had a little toy that rolled away from him and he sat there.
the toy that rolls.
down there near your belt.
mmhm.
to eat the bird.
you do?
that's going to pop.
your name.
no, that's al.
this is hl.
yes, that's Hercules.
Hercules begins with an hl.
your name begins with a al.
Paul's name begins with a pl.
al dl al ml.
al.
ml.
no, it seems that something must have been broken.
I don't know what it was part of.
I don't think Robin would have been walking down Washington Street.
you thought you had it.
I don't know who broke it.
no, I didn't break it.
you didn't break it.
it looks like the one that was on our rug that came back from the
this been wrapped on here.
it came from that and some little boy was playing with it on the
and the company man came?
the mailman?
an advertisement?
what're they advertising?
careful careful.
what is that now?
you don't use your fishing rod like that.
thank you.
for catching fish.
the Indians tied him up.
why would you tie the poor Indians up?
why?
because he tied the cowboy up?
they're going to beat him up?
why are they going to do that?
you like Indians that way?
how're you goING To catch those.
they look too tiny to bite.
those are baby fish.
why would you put that in your mouth?
why would you put that in your mouth?
no.
these go on paper that you put in notebooks.
and this keeps the holes from tearing.
that's alright.
you play on this side.
a what?
American what?
American pole?
what?
what're you doing, Adam?
Adam, what're you doing?
if you break the pencil what will you have to write with?
how could you write with it if you break it?
I don't think that would work.
no no, Adam.
don't break the pencil.
she has to do lots of writing and she needs every pencil she has.
no, you don't know what to do with pencils any more.
no, Mommy doesn't let you play with pencils anymore, does she?
why would you do that?
you tell Ursula why you can't play with pencils anymore?
no, I'm talking about the ones you used for writing on the walls.
for you?
would you like a house?
alright.
shall we close the door?
what?
I was talking to your Mother.
Adam, did you go to school this morning?
did you tell her that you ate lunch at school and you came home and
you must have been so hungry, Adam.
what did you have for lunch at school today?
you don't know.
yes.
if I were you?
what?
why does your tummy cry?
Adam, what are you peeking at already?
to eat?
you had two lunches already.
why do you want something to eat?
she has two.
how many do you have?
ten?
she didn't tell you you could look in there.
oh, you're not peeking.
don't you peek then until you ask her.
well, what's the difference in looking and peeking?
did you show Ursula your art gallery?
that's very nice.
did you show her your basket?
where's the hole, Adam?
where's one hole?
oh, you mean one place to put things.
no, not yet.
what are they?
so you can turn the train around in two places.
did you tell Ursula what we did Sunday, Adam?
what else did you do?
you did nothing?
oh, we need to use tracks to put it together.
you have to attach it with train tracks.
the train track's in the box.
what?
it's a support for the track.
what do you think that is?
you could guess.
well, you're close.
but it's something that goes along with the train.
must be a railroad crossing sign.
what did you tell me?
a sponge.
what do you think it's for?
maybe to clean the track.
mmhm.
the other set of wheels must have come off.
perhaps the wheels are down in the box.
what?
two weeks ago there was a little doll that was made in Italy.
oh.
I don't know.
are they two trains or just one train?
the black tracks don't belong to the same set.
because most of the train tracks that are outside are black aren't
they made them this way.
oh, you know how to put that together.
why don't you know how?
what bag, dear?
they have brakes just like cars have brakes for stopping.
you almost stepped on your finger.
a finger toe.
what's a finger toe?
finger people.
what kind of people are those?
oh?
what did you say?
I know you said Italy but what did you say before you said Italy.
injure me or something?
oh, when you used to be in Italy.
oh, when did you go to Italy?
what did you see in Italy?
lions and Italy tigers?
Italian tigers?
are they different from any other tigers?
how are they different?
oh, they're different than those we have here in Boston?
they different them?
what do you mean?
do you know an Italian song?
do you know anything about Italy at all?
what do you know about Italy?
somebody told you about Italy?
could you tell us about Italy, please?
I'd like to know.
come on, let's finish the train.
not yet.
no, she said not yet.
did you tell Ursula what you heard this morning.
a motor boat on the street?
what was a motor boat doing out on the street?
you what?
try to get it back.
I didn't hear a motor boat.
I thought you were putting them together.
yes.
I should think so.
what did you do at nursery school this morning, Adam?
did you go outside at nursery school?
what did you do outside?
you didn't ?
what did you do?
you rode on the Dodge car?
oh, it was a small one?
a small tricycle?
I don't know what a Dodge car is.
oh?
yes.
well, people are born all over the world.
you were born in America.
no.
no, you were born in Boston.
because your mother and father live in Boston.
Italian people, yes.
how do you flash them?
I don't really think they come on or anything.
it doesn't seem to.
I think that's a different train.
don't you think so?
I don't remember what goes first on the train.
what comes first on the train?
what is that?
Adam, you put it under that place where the track goes up, look.
well, it could be that way.
no, turn it around.
on the side.
this way.
it says stop and go.
for the cars that are waiting to cross the track maybe.
well yes, they do.
when there's a train track across a street you have to cross part of
yes.
because they have a factory.
well, sometimes, perhaps there's something wrong with the train or
I don't know.
are you doing it very carefully?
that's right.
I think that doesn't go there.
it's stopped?
no, that's plastic, I think.
here's a piece that isn't broken.
you need some more track.
here's a piece.
put it under the bridge.
it needs another piece of track.
are you too tired?
it's time for what?
I thought you said something about Italy.
oh no.
I didn't say I don't have it.
did I?
later, alright?
let's put this one on.
just the way you put the track on, look.
it's hard.
let's move it over so we have more room.
yes.
you need some more track, don't you?
oh, thank you.
what're you doing, Adam?
what are you using it for, Adam?
they don't fit on that set.
no, but it doesn't fit.
in case you need it.
yes?
a meeting?
I don't hear Paul.
no, that was someone on the street, dear.
talking, I suppose.
oh, Adam, why did you do that?
you're going to put it back on?
how did your hands get so dirty?
no, I don't think that's the wrong way.
if you don't put that down that's part of my bed.
what do you need a rifle for?
why do you want to shoot?
shoot cows?
poor cows.
then what will you do for milk?
how do you know which cows are bad cows?
well, how will you know which ones to fight?
cry them and then you're going to eat them for supper?
your automatic rifle.
no, you can't play with this, this is part of my automatic bed.
no no, Adam, you don't hit anybody with that.
ok?
chopper.
Adam, don't break it, dear.
because it's not yours.
why would you want to pull that anyway?
that must be something new, is it?
automatic bow and arrow?
oh, what is that?
why do you need to flash the light?
why?
why?
lights flash?
said what?
winter stop?
what does that mean?
Koolaid train?
what's the Koolaid song?
what?
you did?
you didn't get hurt, did you?
no.
no no.
here's a turntable you haven't even put on yet.
Adam, do you know why that doesn't fit in there?
it's not round?
you know how to put that in.
it's what?
it's stopped?
well, why don't you try pushing this down.
broken finger.
two dirty fingers, but I don't think they're broken.
dirty dirty fingers.
the sheriff?
no no.
don't do that, Adam.
that's no shovel.
Adam, you're silly.
are you silly?
why don't you go get your cards.
yes, you knocked that down.
put it back up there.
no no, Adam.
you may break that.
put it up on the dresser.
what are you going to do with that?
no more being silly.
that's enough being silly.
Adam, what did the lady say when she told you that story.
story about George Washington.
whoever read that story to you?
did she tell you all of the story or did she just stop with the
did she tell you?
she did?
let's have a race.
have a race?
ok.
mine did too.
mine didn't .
no no, Adam.
your horse is for riding, Adam.
but you chop outside where there are trees.
Adam.
you're trying to do what?
don't break it anymore, dear.
you are?
you cannot?
why not?
I can put it together but it willn't stay without glue.
yes.
what did I do to those?
I put glue on them.
one day we'll get some and make them.
no, they aren't supposed to come off.
we were doing a train track and then you stopped.
yes.
alright.
you put it together.
you put it together and then I'll come and play with you.
why did you do that?
playing the banjo.
no, you play the banjo.
what's the panjoc?
why do you call it the panjoc?
yes.
they're wrong?
why are they wrong?
would you like to do a puzzle?
what puzzle would you like to do?
what puzzle is that?
I don't know what puzzle that is.
you have to look.
no.
Adam.
why do you think that's the wrong place in Italy when you're not
you have to take them apart, Adam.
you have a broken leg.
how did you get a broken leg?
no, Adam, you've got parts of the sign on the floor there.
no no.
there're some more.
here's one.
what do you think it's for?
can't you take them out?
then perhaps you're not big enough to play with those, if those are
you are.
yes, you pull the corners of the plastic, don't you?
want me to show you?
I can't see cowboy hat.
look at that stretching.
stretching.

you don't need to pull this all the way down.
no.
no.
no.
can you think about it?
Mr Owl!
Mr Package?
careful.
no no no.
it's called a tsquare.
does it look like anything you've seen before?
he's working with his father.
he's making something.
no.
look at the things you can make.
what is this?
what kind of house?
you have to have wood.
those are nice, Adam.
perhaps you can get some wood and you can make a bird house.
well, that's not really for trees.
for making small things.
what will I do with that?
you do?
I'll let you use this.
it's called a level.
for being sure that things are straight.
it's a drill.
you can make holes with it.
let me see.
I think I might have something.
see?
see?
what are you making?
why don't you want to cut it?
see?
it really works, doesn't it?
no, you try it.
don't put your fingers down there because it's very sharp.
oh yes, you can.
no, I don't want to do it.
I'm not a little boy.
no, I'm not.
which hand do you use?
a drill.
makes a hole for a screw.
it's a file.
look at the edge and you see something like teeth and when you pull
here's a nail, would you like to try?
be careful you don't hit your hand, Adam.
I'll hold it.
you do it.
want to try it in here?
ouch.
you almost caught me.
why would you hold it with that?
you have to learn.
take your time.
alright.
see?
well, you have to learn how.
if you had a big what?
don't hit my fingers.
you do it.
you do.
you're always turning my beater.
I'll hold it while you turn.
it willn't move.
where's the fish?
oh, I'm watching the fish.
the fish stopped?
why did he stop?
you turn it, dear.
a tsquare for making things straight?
first you mark with a pencil.
I guess they were Cub_Scouts.
cut what?
why?
why?
oh, you can't put it back on once you've cut it off.
well, I can't finish it by myself.
maybe you can drill a hole too.
on this part.
alright.
turn around.
no, not on the floor.
cut what?
yes, that's sharp.
you'll cut your fingers.
no, I'm not going to do it.
did you try marking with this?
no.
I have a blue one.
why don't you write with it first?
I'll hold this while you draw a straight line.
but you have to hold your pencil against there.
oh well, there are lots of things that are hard to do that we have
watch your fingers.
don't cut your thumb, Adam.
oh no, you cut it.
well, then perhaps you're not big enough to play with the tools.
oh, you're going to cut yourself.
you haven't cut yourself yet.
are you sure?
you've got to be careful now.
hmm?
a wrench?
screw it.
no.
that's right.
that's the way you screw.
now how can you unscrew it?
if you had to unscrew how would you do it?
you hurt yourself.
you could drill a hole through that.
I'll hold it and you turn, I've seen carpenters do that, have you?
sometimes I watch them build houses and make furniture.
use your hammer and take it out.
now you can drill right through there.
you can screw that on.
where's your screwdriver?
mmhm.
did you look behind you?
very good.
why did you knock it?
did you try cutting that?
you could turn it over and cut a door in it.
you're sleepy, aren't you?
are you going to take a nap tomorrow?
yes.
watch your fingers, Adam.
pull it back and forth.
what?
ok.
no, dear.
I can't use that while you're there.
turn that.
how can it be an old hole when you just made it?
that has to be a new hole.
what do you need to open it for?
there.
what are you going to put in there anyway?
what would you want to put?
that's right.
you can't .
why not?
are you getting a runny nose?
can you pull it out now?
that's a level.
to see if something is straight.
some water.
where's your saw?
you can make a door that opens.
can I take a message?
can you cut along here, Adam?
shall we do it together?
that's it.
there's a door.
you did?
a car?
is that a garage?
I think you have a car up there on the shelf that might just fit in.
on the top shelf.
on the other side.
maybe Paul took it.
you what?
yes?
I don't think he really has it because he's upstairs sleeping.
here are two little cars.
one named Joe?
and what's the other one's name?
what was that you were doing Adam?
two little birdies?
how does that go?
what are two little birdies?
oh, thank you.
thank you.
the magnet?
no, I didn't .
I looked for it at home too.
it must be lost someplace.
I have as many toys in my house as you have in yours.
a lot of toys, yes.
be careful that you don't cut your fingers with that.
a what?
how can that be a key?
Christmas what?
in June?
here's al.
no.
no, your name is al.
Arnold.
begins with al.
well, that's not really big enough for a tree.
the pencil came apart because it is small, but a tree is big.
oh?
what birdies would live in a tree with a hole in it?
Paul woke up last night and was just playing in his bed.
you can't ?
look what's happening.
it's changing color, isn't it?
just what's on the paper is changing color.
green.
you take another color.
I'll change.
you take this.
you eat yourself up?
why would you want to do that?
it's true.
you can eat yourself if you want to.
I just don't know why.
I should think that's hard.
you're going to eat yourself up?
why are you going to do that?
you can?
you're telling jokes on yourself?
that's what I thought.
Adam, are you still sleepy?
you're just yawning.
what made you get up so early?
I'm just putting some things away.
so we'll have some space for walking.
in your refrigerator?
where's your refrigerator?
did you go to school this morning?
you didn't have a cold.
you had a sore throat.
his tonsils were enlarged.
where are they, Adam?
when the hammer knocked you down.
what hammer?
yes.
in the toy box?
you're a toy?
oh, you're not a toy?
all about what?
I was going to put this together.
you have to screw it.
I think perhaps it's the wrong way.
I think perhaps that's the right way.
no.
a bench.
what do you think?
mmhm.
perhaps there's a tiny one to go in the tiny hole.
it's a ruler.
I don't know.
how did what?
I don't know.
he fell down?
why don't you turn it over?
I'll hold this.
there it is.
oh, you lost something.
careful, so you don't hit your hand.
hold it straight.
what do you want, Adam?
that's what I thought.
I don't think so.
I don't quite know how that fits on there.
what is it?
I think perhaps something is missing.
I think she's right.
what's missing?
I don't know what you'd call that.
do you see the pilot?
what do you think it is?
let's try to figure it out.
what does he need if he jumps out?
what is it saying?
that's one of the wheels.
did you remember what this is on his back?
you've got one.
and when you throw it up in the air what happens?
I don't know where you put it.
Adam, when it opens it looks like this.
yes.
now it's all folded up.
does the other pilot have one too?
would you like to look at a book?
I have an al bl cl book.
ok.
maybe we can read it together.
look, what is that?
this must be the letter al.
what is that?
ant.
acorn.
what is this?
look at that.
it's another ant.
and that's
Captain Bob has one of these.
do you remember what it is?

ducks.
a bear?
oh, I've never seen a bear that looked like that.
oh, you said doggie.
what is this?
what are these?
if this is a drum and you have these with the drum what do you call
take a guess.
no, what would you call those?
if you have a drum and you play the drum with these what would you
that's pretty good.
drum sticks.
and what are these?
these are dragon flies.
those are dragon flies.
that's a donkey.
this is the letter el.
and what are these?
these are tusks tusks.
no.
what is this?
no.
that's an eggplant.
we'll see one next time we go the grocery store.
what is this?
look again.
what kind of bird?
eagle.
and what is this?
what is that?
what kind of eggs?
Easter eggs.
don't you have something like that at nursery school?
gears.
if you turn one they all turn.
because they're all linked together.
this is fl.
he's the color of grass.
and he hops.
what do you think he might be?
yes, a grasshopper.
I didn't know you knew these in the book.
what are these?
no, that's a flamingo.
no, it's a flamingo.
this is the letter hl.
what is that?
yes.
what is this?
oh, he'd probably run from you.
he's probably frightened of people.
he just likes other hippopotamus.
what?
what is this?
is that a rooster?
that looks like a hen.
cackleo cackleo cackleo cackleo.
what is this?
what is that?
and what is the house on?
it's a hill.
no, I don't think so.
no, that's the path or perhaps that's a cement walk where you
it would be a nice place to slide in winter, wouldn't it?
and what is this?
who's there?
Jiminy Cricket who?
this is il and this is
what are these?
well, they're jelly beans.
what is that?
it's jelly or jam.
and what is this?
that's a jug.
what are those?
you're silly.
where?
no, those are his claws.
yes, but what is it?
is it a lobster or a crab or swordfish or whale?
oh, that's no whale.
it's a lobster.
no, snake doesn't look like that, does he?
I don't think that's a turtle.
that's a lobster.
that's a lizard.
he's a little animal who lives outside.
no, I don't think so.
let's do this page first.
what is this?
what are those, Adam?
no.
you're guessing.
those are nickels.
what is this?
no, a needle.
because it's a

where are two?
where is a peach?
what's that?
you what?
you what?
what is this?
oh, you don't know what that is?
what is it?
I knew you didn't know.
what does that look like?
a pineapple.
do you know who this is?
I think you do.
she's married to a king.
yeah, it's a lady.
what about a queen?
yes.
yes.
let's find a king.
mmhm.
oh, you're a snake?
you're all wound up like a snake too.
what is that?
no, he's got something around his eyes.
a raccoon.
a raccoon.
because that's the way a snake has to move.
he winds himself up and he straightens out.
well no.
that's just a shell.
it is shaped like a snail.
and what is this?
yes, I think so.
if he's not a snapping turtle.
can you visit his Mother?
I guess if you wanted to.
if you knew where his Mother was.
what is that?
oh, look again.
you pull it up and close it and you pull it down and you open it.
yes.
yes, that is a nice book, isn't it?
well, put the book back.
who're you going to put in the bag with you?
they willn't fit either.
ok, bring it over and I'll help you.
that's right.
did your Mother take it?
here it is.
up here on your dresser.
blow.
I'll wipe it off.
a little one.
can you throw it up?
the pea.
always squeeze from the bottom.
blow again.
you don't need to throw your arms up to blow.
alright.
mine had a hole in it.
ok, you're going to blow now?
the heat?
who's going down, Adam?
are you going to blow it?
blow.
blow again.
wait, my finger's caught.
are you having fun?
why does it fall apart, Adam?
why does it?
a what?
I don't close it properly, I guess.
the part that comes out of the blower.
yes, it disappeared.
well, it takes practice.
what happens when you laugh?
blow.
blow again.
what?
is this what you said you wanted to make?
careful, you'll put a hole in it.
there's a little left.
that would make a nice hat.
I'll make one if you like.
for cooking?
eat this?
it's alright.
there's one over there behind you.
it's stuck on your pants.
a snow man.
but this is stuck.
let's try one of these.
shall I tie it?
no, she doesn't want to blow that.
she blew one up.
it's a sailboat?
I don't know.
what do you think it's for?
well, close your eyes and try it.
look at that.
it's a little hard.
you can't do that.
I have a little printing set.
yes, you can take them apart.
I have a little printing set.
yes, you can take them apart.
you're trying to do what?
it's the ink pad.
you can't ?
just leave that in, Adam.
may I try it once?
be very careful with this one.
turn it over and press it down.
there.
it printed.
what?
there's ink on the pad and you press the ink on the paper.
is that a bl?
what is it?
to what?
has?
what does he have?
oh.
he was playing a game with a little girl the other day.
was it Cynthia?
the little girl with whom you were playing the other day.
just a little girl.
you've never seen her?
no?
she's a little girl.
you didn't do very many.
ok.
maybe it ran away.
where is the al?
is this it?
what?
doubly doubly with gum.
I think there's an advertisement that says.
double your pleasure.
oh, that's it.
you saw that on tv.
there's a dot that says cross your printing set?
oh, Adam, what is this?
you only did one side.
there's one over there.
what is this the top to?
is that the top or is that the bottom?
where's the bottom?
no.
your what?
your finger print?
where?
yes, we did.
I see it.
I see two.
you know what?
what is that?
no, it's not.
Captain Bob has one what?
that's better.
no, what did he used to have?
what did he have that for?
did he walk on it?
what did he do?
he just had it.
what is that?
that's better.
but that's a pl.
no, pl.
pl as in Paul.
mmhm.
al dl al ml.
I don't know.
what do you think we should do?
I think you've had everything in the bag now.
do you know whose name that is?
no.
no.
no.
it's part of whose name?
Bambi?
no, that's part of Hercules' name.
you're the doggie who ran away?
what's your name?
it's already in.
oh, perhaps that's the kind you look through.
what was it?
hold it up toward the light.
I don't know.
what is it?
put it on the chair.
hold it up toward the light.
a may fly.
put it on the chair, honey.
what do you think it is?
it's a stone fly.
what made you think that was a joke?
is that really what that is, Adam?
yes.
what do you think it is?
what does it look like?
what is it?
maybe it's the same dragonfly.
what does it look like?
is that what I look like?
a giant water bug?
let's see, Adam, what the next one is.
you tell me what they look like and I'll tell you what they are.
what's that?
hold it toward the light.
stone fly.
whoever saw a stone fly?
you did?
how did you see a stone fly?
is that a dragon fly?
I think you have that wrong.
can you be a dragonfly?
careful with your dirty fingers.
they are blue, yes.
no, they are blue.
they have blue ink on them.
it's probably your finger.
what do you think it is?
this is a fish fly.
I never saw a fish fly.
I think you have it in the wrong way.
that's a giant water bug.
it's a water scorpion.
right there.
just turn toward the light.
this must be a new one.
what is it?
my brother got those.
what's your brother's name?
what's your brother's name?
Adam, don't you have a brother?
I thought so.
what's his name?
what's your sister's name?
Cora Lee?
that's my sister.
your girl?
you don't have a girl.
don't put your fingers here.
yes, I think I got it from you.
that's a may fly.
that's a finger.
a finger print?
that's a water bug.
yes, I suppose so.
it's almost like a stone fly.
what is so dangerous?
that's a giant water bug.
you're trying to get it in?
keep trying.
just takes a little practice.
shall we put them back?
alright.
did you go shopping?
what did you get?
you dropped all the slides.
does he talk?
I don't know that he talks.
I don't think he talks, does he?
his feet?
you march with it.
what does that look like?
what do you think?
what do you think that is?
did you tell Ursula what the doctor found in your ears the other
the Doctor found some birdies.
hello, Adam.
hello, Adam.
hmm?
hello said the bird.
hello said the bunny.
would you like to keep the birdie?
alright.
those are some pictures.
why don't you take two?
how many do you have?
she said two.
one.
put the others back.
you've given up on Mommy blowing.
I'm afraid I can't blow them up.
I guess I put all the air in Bobof when I blew him up yesterday.
you have?
how do you know it's big air?
you really caught it.
I tried very hard.
no, I didn't break my mouth.
oh.
two arms?
thank you for what?
a bottle?
a bottle of what?
oh.
it popped.
oh, you're juggling.
haven't you had enough balloons?
she willn't have any to give to Robin and David.
no.
what color are these?
what color is this?
this is orange.
that is red.
one red and two orange.
why don't you sing that song?
you don't need another.
why don't you sing that song for Ursula?
what is that song?
sing it for Ursula?
it's a rattlesnake?
I don't know.
what is that in your shoe?
is it going to bite?
it was an animal.
what kind of animal?
hmm?
it must have come from another one.
where's my farmyard truck?
I guess not.
you what?
you went out at nursery school.
what did you play outside?
you played Daddy?
Daddy Adam?
you played cowboy?
some visitors are coming at my house?
why?
why?
in my back?
in your bag?
in what bag?
you almost did.
I see something up here.
do you see anything on here?
I thought perhaps if you looked you could tell me.
I see something.
mmhm.
what kind of bird is it?
what do you mean on my bone leg?
how can you throw snowballs.
there's no snow.
no no no.
let's not throw things.
why do you say that?
they don't feel like snow.
I'm not.
it is not snow.
how does snow feel?
how does snow feel?
did you tell Ursula what movie you saw Saturday?
you were telling me about a movie that you saw.
airplane movie?
I thought you said it was about somebody fighting something.
some kind of fighter.
remember?
somebody had a red
oh, a bull fighter.
you don't fight the bull like that, do you?
you have a little cape?
we'll take you out another day.
ok.
you're supposed to move.
or else the bull will knock you down.
ok.
why don't you try to throw an animal in the bag?
good.
don't stand so close.
pick the animals up and throw them in.
good.
good.
good.
good.
you missed.
you're a silly.
do you know that?
why would you do that?
oh, poor mummy.
no.
oh, I don't want to shoot you.
no, I don't like shooting.
throw that at you?
ok.
I'll throw that at you.
what's the matter?
why did you ask me to do that?
you want to play?
ok.
what do you want to play?
I'm not playing Indian.
why don't you ask Ursula where she got this?
no.
no.
Ursula is Ursula.
Adam is Adam?
spear is spear?
you didn't ask her about those.
I think she has an interesting story to tell about those.
you did?
you must have a big tummy ache.
if you ate all of those animals certainly you must have a big
I don't want to eat my animals.
but I don't want any animals.
but I don't want any animals.
no, you missed my mouth anyway.
no.
where does that go?
which hand?
which hand?
that hand?
the other hand.
what's the matter with your finger, Adam?
but doesn't it hurt, Adam?
why?
don't mash your finger, Adam.
it will hurt you.
why does your finger hurt?
you had it in your mouth so much?
oh, I'm sorry.
you did?
you did?
how do you play baseball?
oh, you swing the bat.
and what do you do?
and someone has a glove.
and what else?
why do you swing the bat?
oh, you play golf too?
how do you play golf?
neither have I.
she didn't say that.
OH, what is that you have in your hand?
why don't you show Ursula your puppets?
what kind of puppets are they?
what is she doing?
I don't think they want to fight.
I think they're friends.
they're kissing.
how did you hurt your finger?
scratched it on something?
why don't you tell Ursula about the television program you saw?
a fish.
a fish fell down!
oh, you're not a fish.
no.
a finger fish.
I've seen a whale.
in a book.
I don't know where the book is now.
why did it do that?
it's a patrol car.
I think it's just skinned a little.
scraped.
perhaps you hit it against something and some of the skin came off.
what do you think?
why don't you get it and see what it does?
what's the matter?
it looks like a friendly animal.
what do you think it is?
you didn't play much with it.
look how nice and soft it is.
you don't .
why don't we name it something.
no, you tell me what it is.
it's something you've seen.
is it as tall as a giraffe?
what is the music it's playing?
oh, tell me why you're frightened.
there.
isn't it nice and soft?
why don't you get your book and see if you see anything that looks
huh?
it can't really walk.
let's look in the book.
you don't have what?
those are fish.
do you think so?
look at it carefully.
look at it carefully.
ask Ursula if that's , it is.
yes.
some people eat snails, yes.
because they like them.
no, I don't think I'd like to eat snails.
because it's the custom in their country to eat snails.
is he friendly?
that's what?
oh, that's church music?
what's the name of the song?
does it?
it's a bug.
mmhm.
what?
I'm not sure that it does anything with the bee.
do they have beginning sounds that are alike?
what about bird?
no.
I don't know what kind they are.
it's a pretty color, isn't it?
nothing.
it just plays nice music.
oh, you do?
you'll have to talk to Ursula about that.
what shall we do?
alright.
look at it carefully.
perhaps you can find out.
I think it would be much more fun if you find out.
you look very carefully.
ok, I'm looking too.
I don't know if it's that way.
what is this?
a house?
what kind of a house?
I was just putting them on there.
you tell me what sound they make as you pick them up.
and what?
oh, you turned into a flower pot too.
that's not white, that's brown, isn't it?
you were right at first.
white.
brown and white.
because they were painted that way or made that color.
in the factory?
oh, we we have a factory?
where?
what do we make in our factory?
oh, what is that?
what is that?
look at it carefully.
it says gobble gobble gobble.
did you?
because it is a
turkey.
can you?
yes.
yes.
you buy them from the grocery store.
there're so many.
will you fit?
what did?
what ate all the farm animals up?
it's a what?
do what?
what do you mean?
is that a dance he's doing?
ok, he's all put together.
what is that?
they just left this.
when they were cutting the animal out.
they didn't take this off.
it's the same kind of thing, isn't ?
that's just something extra.
I don't know.
you'll have to ask Ursula.
I think you could.
she can't see it.
mmhm.
yes, probably he'll put them in his mouth.
because he likes to put things in his mouth.
alright.
how shall we do it?
do you have something for fences, Adam?
your fences.
I was walking, rocking on your leg.
oh, I'm so sorry.
what melted?
is that how it goes?
they don't go together do they, Adam?
a fence.
alright.
you make part of it too.
is that where you want the door to be?
alright.
let that be the door.
there's one behind it.
oh, did they?
alright.
the lamb's Mother?
did you look behind you?
is that a baby lamb?
no, I think it's really a dog.
oh, you opened it, didn't you?
yes, because they're frightened of the big tractor.
because it's so big.
Mr farmer, don't you have a small tractor?
do you have a tractor that's smaller than that one?
you mean in here?
alright.
mmhm.
yes.
not on the farm when the animals are out.
because it might run over some of the animals.
it might hurt the animals because the tractor's so big.
the rest of what?
oh, there's food for the animals.
what is it?
oh, each one gets it and each one eats it?
what is it?
yes.
sometimes they catch them and eat them.
hmm?
Adam, I hear something over here talking in your farm yard.
quack quack quack quack quack.
what was that?
I don't know.
quack quack quack quack quack quack.
quack quack quack quack quack quack.
it stopped.

I don't know.
why do you think they they have windows?

so that the animals can see out and can have air in the barn.
those are windows aren't they?
why should there be men in there?
what's that?
you bowl.
they're already up.

do you see the pumpkin?
something was blowing around?

perhaps you'd like to look at another one.

there are a few stories and lots of cities.
any particular city you'd like to see?
which one?
city or state?
can you think of one you'd like to see?
what state?
you changed your mind.
here's another story.
Goldilocks' mother, that's Goldilocks.
Goldilocks discovers whose house?
the bear's house.
this is the story of Goldilocks and

three bears.
mmhm.
what is Goldilocks doing?
she's eating all the baby bear's porridge.
what's happening now?
she's breaking Baby_Bear's chair.
well, I can read it.

the baby bear discovers Goldilocks in his bed.
Goldilocks runs away from the three bears.
because she's frightened.

and Jack trades the pig for a bean.
that's part of the machine.

the man who's standing up has a guitar.
do you know what a guitar is?
it looks more like a big violin, doesn't it?
your legs hurt?
what happened to the cowboy?
that's a ranch.
except we don't call that a banjo.
what is that?
look again.
I don't think that's a banjo.
that doesn't look like what Mr Greenjeans plays.
look again.
what is that?
oh, you're silly.

these are nice, Adam.
let's look at this one.
this is about Holland Michigan.
there are some flowers here that you've seen before.
see if you can tell me what kind they are.
are they all the same color?
you think so?
yes.
the ones in front are the same color.
aren't they pretty?
yes, they are tulips.
here's something I think you'll like, Adam.
I think you'll like that.
alright.
you got it in.
how does that work, Adam?
alright.
that's nice.
can you put it back together?
I don't know if I know how.
which goes on top?
she does?
oh, Paul.
isn't that dirty?
Adam, do you remember what I told you I saw at the museum?
why don't you tell Ursula about it?
what is a squirmc?
what is a squirmc worm?
oh, that's a nice hat.
I don't suppose I've seen anyone else with a hat on like that.
oh, that's a church hat?
why is that a church hat?
well, this is the top one.
here's the other one.
can't you turn it?
there it is.
where are your marbles?
there's one over these.
no no no.
where's the other one?
what is an earache?
those are the guys?
this is mine.
where's yours?
oh?
this is a fix if you want yours in a particular place.
oh no, I don't have any more cranberry juice.
that was the last cranberry juice.
I didn't buy any cranberries, I bought some strawberries.
yes.
that's enough.
no, we're going to have those for supper.
wait, I don't feel like boxing.
you're going to beat me all up?
yep.
close the door, Adam.
oh, thank you very much.
what is this?
what is this?
what is this?
no, that's dl.
what is this?
whoops.
excuse me.
you alright?
I didn't do that.
I was holding the cart and you hit your face on the cart.
because I was afraid you were hurt.
you're a dinosaur?
well, what are you?
can you learn the cards first?
you put them in separate groups on the floor.
what is this?
what is this?
yes, how did you know?
the tagalong man.
who is that?
where does the al go?
what is that?
no, dl.
here's another one.
it sounds like you're scratching your floor.
you wouldn't scratch your floor, would you?
what do you mean the top floor?
remember, Paul's a dinosaur.
all the other animals are afraid of a dinosaur because he's so big.
oh, you're a dinosaur too.
you're the big brother dinosaur.
I don't know why.
Adam, you didn't go to school this morning.
we didn't realize it but the school was closed because of the
no, not today.
no, not today.
can you ride it, Adam?
what're you doing?
Paul is thirteen months.
whyn't cha sing the song you heard last night?
about the cowboy?
cowboy who needs a hat.
yes.
well, he was dreaming.
he didn't wake up but that was the dream.
in the dream he was the cowboy.
is that a song on a record?
we saw it on Walt_Disney.
but you say it?
what happened?
did the horse hurt you?
Adam, did you have a dream last night?
you didn't ?
no.
no, I don't think so.
I'm afraid the horse may get hurt driving into a truck.
why do you say he has wheels?
I don't know.
what color are his eyes.
do you know?
I don't think it really turns, does it?
well, how would you turn it?
careful.
mmhm.
you ran over a bean bag.
are you in a rodeo?
your horse threw you off?
careful.
you have to watch out for Paul's fingers.
you didn't ?
watch Paul.
yes, you almost ran over me.
in your garage?
what are you going to put in your garage?
you wouldn't put your horse there, would you?
horses should have a barn.
does it close?
let me see.
want some sugar, horse?
here, horsie.
oh?
here, Paul, give the horsie some sugar.
hi, Adam.
that's no mixer.
Adam, let Paul try this.
stop crying, Paul.
why are you doing that?
where is the pie?
that must be a special kind of horse.
what kind of horse is this?
a wheelbarrow horse.
would you find that horse in a special place?
but you made him?
does he have a name?
does he have a name?
what's his name?
what?
Gil?
watch those fingers.
did you get stepped on?
that was just an accident he said.
what is the horse killing?
why?
oh, what is it you're killing?
no.
yes, but what is it supposed to be?
to kill the noise?
you mean stop the noise.
because that's the way it's made.
that's a saddle, isn't it?
I guess.
how do they do what?
you put your foot like the policeman we saw.
well, I don't ride in it because I'm too big.
there's a make-believe place right there where you put your foot.
sit in the saddle, and your feet to right there.
what did you say?
no no.
yes, if there's nothing in your way.
mmhm.
I don't know really.
where're you going?
what?
ok.
don't have an accident now.
you did?
very good.
you going to let the horse rest for a little?
don't pull the microphone any more.
that was the bean bag and the boat too.
the boat was back there.
no no, dirty.
alright.
can you say ball?
oh, it's not?
ok.
what?
I'm going to someone's house now?
alright.
whose house?
oh, we haven't got there?
but we're landing down to get some more people.
ok.
hello.
ok.
I'm out.
I'm out.
get back in the airplane?
no no, Paul.
Adam is playing with the airplane.
oh, why is it doing that?
oh, that's not an accident.
how does an airplane come down?
does it come straight down?
he drives?
why does he do that?
drive.
because it doesn't have a motor.
I don't really know where a motor is on an airplane.
why don't you ask Ursula.
perhaps she knows.
this is the landing wheel.
after you get up in the air it folds back.
because it has a motor and it has a pilot to drive it.
I guess it's misplaced.
it must be lost.
no, in Robin's home.
what doesn't move?
what's the matter, Paulie?
oh no, I don't think you should throw it.
oh no, I don't think you're supposed to do that.
it's not a real airplane.
why do I put my hand on it?
I don't know.
it's just not in here.
it's just lost.
then wind it up again.
why can't you?
how can a what?
get an airplane when it's up in the sky?
well, it can't because a bulldozer doesn't what?
what does an airplane do?
well, does a bulldozer?
why?
you know.
a bulldozer doesn't fly.
it doesn't have any wings.
Adam, why don't you want to do this yourself?
no, don't do that.
you may break it and it's Paul's .
I don't know.
it's going to do what?
you're not?
well, I don't think a horse can fly.
I don't suppose he can catch it.
yes, perhaps he can if he can run that fast.
another what?
that would be very funny, Adam.
why don't you stand back a little further?
I'll have the green one.
thank you.
alright.
I missed.
you throw it.
you throw first.
that's green.
no, I have two and you have two.
but if you take one of mine how many will you have?
now, how many do you have?
five!
count them.
how many do you have?
you have how many?
count them.
one two three.
will you throw?
he doesn't want to throw.
I'll throw it for him.
thank you.
what?
somebody missed?
Paul has what?
if Paul gets one how can you have four if there are only four?
oh, you didn't say which one.
thank you, Adam.
you what?
you didn't miss.
why did you have to do that?
it doesn't matter how they fall, does it, as long as they're on?
is this my birthday?
what kind of cake is it?
icecream cake.
how old is Mommy?
oh, you're six and I'm seven.
what are you shooting or are you just cooking?
what kind of gun is that?
is that a new style gun?
a bullet gun?
what does a bullet gun do?
alright.
will you give me a slice?
thank you very much.
that's your slice, isn't it?
oh, Adam, you're a very good cook.
well, what is that?
what is that?
they're so many you're afraid they're going to fall off?
what happened?
oh, thank you.
that's very good.
what do you call that?
icecream dessert?
what's too big?
what?
you smell me?
how do I smell?
difficult.
no, I don't .
what does difficult smell like?
you didn't tell Ursula yet what Mommy burned.
that's the strange odor you smelled.
I'll tie your shoes.
are you a dancer, Adam?
what?
what do you have on your shoulder?
colors put on?
those are what cowboys put on.
what is it?
but the cow?
oh, is that the rope?
I don't like shooting.
didn't one go in your garage?
what other one?
how many did you have?
how many do you have?
count them again.
so, how many are you missing?
how can you be missing two if you have four now.
didn't you count four?
you certainly do talk a lot.
you need six?
you do.
they're really having a vacation.
you're going to have one, aren't you?
what is it?
tell me what it is.
oh, it's a cave.
yes, they're nice.
thank you.
does this have a name?
where's the name?
would you like to cut them?
you'd like to cut them.
I'll get some scissors.
alright.
are you tired?
what?
did you ask Ursula if it's alright to cut?
oh yes.
what is this?
how can I wear it?
it doesn't stay.
what is that?
a worm.
not in your mouth.
Paul.
who?
what kind of trouble, Adam?
what people?
thank you.
here are my cuttings?
they're not right?
what's wrong with them?
well, then they must be right.
why're you getting tired of cutting?
you need some what?
razors.
what do you use razors for?
what is that for?
this is shaving cream.
yes, Paul wants to shave.
do you have a razor blade, Adam?
one side is alright.
I don't see a mirror there.
a mirror.
for you to look in while you shave?
what are those?
razor blades.
it doesn't seem to stay very well.
oh, anyway you want to.
I think it'd be better if you took your hat off.
what does Daddy do?
doesn't he put it on his face?
where does a beard grow?
you look funny.
oh, you've finished shaving?
here, Paul.
Paul.
wait till it stops.
you're going to shave again?
you like to shave.
don't put it in your mouth.
ok.
why don't you go get one of Paul's diapers?
oh my goodness.
you don't give your beard time to grow.
you've finished shaving.
oh, I don't think so.
no.
ladies don't have to shave.
boys when they're almost men, not little boys like you.
David doesn't shave yet.
I don't feel anything there.
why're you going to shave again?
are you going to shave again?
because what?
what happens?
can you see what you're doing?
I think you are sitting on the razor.
he's been trying this for the past several days.
I guess you must be the only man who shaves with a diaper around.
oh, do you know anybody else who might do that?
your Daddy?
you always need something to wipe you off.
you never heard of what?
what?
a red blown chest?
what is that?
a red red blown chest?
what is it?
your Daddy will what?
will surprise?
will surprise that you shave?
when you finish you must put the top because Paul will spill it.
you what?
red ball shoes?
what is a chess?
red ball chess?
what is a chess?
what is a chest?
is it a pair of shoes, is it a shirt, is it a box?
a pair of shoes?
some what?
some blood on you?
why?
when you were shaving?
what happened?
why do you have blood on you?
a cold is blood?
how is that?
a lion.
oh, you can?
how can you?
oh, with your gun?
goodness, you must have used it all.
I guess so.
mmhm.
what is it?
blood?
what is blood?
perhaps.
doesn't that hurt?
your beard is goING To grow?
some what?
some more what?
you're silly.
did you learn that song at home?
what do you see on the tv when they sing that?
don't they show a picture perhaps of a little boy or a little
what're they doing?
you don't what?
do you see that on Captain Kangaroo?
look what you put on the floor?
let Paul have one, honey.
where're you going?
he willn't hurt it.
let him play with some.
you did what?
one of my what?
it wouldn't ?
there's one over there.
he looks like one of George Washington's troops.
one of the members of George Washington's army.
I think we just need one more under here.
it's your hat, Paul.
no, I don't want to.
let Paul wear it.
I don't want to.
why don't we let Paul wear it if you don't want to.
who is George Washington?
nightnight, Adam.
no, don't wipe it off.
you missed it.
use the diaper.
I don't know.
what do you need?
so that the razor will cut the beard.
as long as the blade stays in don't you think that's alright?
but it doesn't stay in.
it doesn't fit properly.
see?
you lost your blade.
mmhm.
now wipe the blade.
you're sitting on some.
wipe the blade.
don't rub it in too much.
then you can't see any.
well, if you wish.
do you want to shave my hand?
you shave with the razor, don't you?
why do you call it cream?
yes, that's cream.
I see.
well, you shave it off.
oh, you're supposed to shave it off.
I'm waiting for you to shave it off my hand.
why're you going to do that?
I did not.
I didn't tell you to use all that.
did I, Paul?
shame on you, Paul.
it ran under the railroad track.
how did it get under there?
no, you shaved those one once.
that you're making?
whose birthday is it?
is it Ursula's too?
no, when is hers?
oh, hers is in July.
under where?
under there?
no thank you.
huh?
yes, that's a track.
what are you doing?
no.
that's for shaving.
it's not for eating.
the cream that you put on there.
you used it all.
why?
why do you need cream?
how could you hold it?
you don't mean razor blades.
you mean a razor?
that what?
oh, that's an electric shaver.
I don't know.
that's an electric shaver.
yes, I think so.
no, I don't think so.
Adam, you look like you're breaking out with something.
on your forehead.
across your nose.
let Ursula look at you.
I don't know.
what does breaking up mean?
go, let Ursula look at it.
you tell her to look right there.
please, don't .
I'm no clown.
I like to eat my pie, not have it thrown in my face.
please, don't .
but we're not clowns in a circus.
we're in a house, but I don't think we're having a circus.
Adam.
no!
yes, you did.
Adam, Mommy saw you hit Paul right in the face.
now don't do that again.
no.
I'll have to spank you right in front of Ursula.
why?
because I spank you when you're naughty?
you had a string in your hair.
I was giving it to you.
no, you have a piece of string.
Adam, do you see anything in the room that sounds like toy?
what has a beginning sound like toy?
no.
well yes, a ball is a toy.
but what has a beginning sound like toy?
train, yes.
that rhymes with it.
train.
house?
a toy house.
anything else?
what?
can you think of anything else that has a beginning sound like toy?
can you say toy?
what about?
yes, truck.
you went to North_Carolina?
where did you stay?
were you on a farm, Adam?
how did you go to North_Carolina?
did you go on the train or come back on the train?
how did you get there, Adam?
your tummy is full.
what did you have for lunch today at nursery school?
pineapple and what else?
pineapple for dessert?
and what else did you have?
what is that?
a bow?
rock you?
did you see any Indians in North_Carolina?
no?
what did you see in North_Carolina?
did you see any cows?
you did so.
and saw the cows being milked?
were men milking them or machines, Adam?
that's a squeaky scooter.
whose scooter do you suppose that is?
it must be Robin's .
is that the way you ride a scooter?
I don't know.
I don't know how to ride a scooter.
you have to go talk to Ursula.
no, I don't think so.
yes, I think so.
because you were laughing.
you weren't laughing?
I see somebody's name, Adam on the.
scooter.
rl ol bl il nl.
whose name is that?
yes, that's Robin.
no, he didn't go to sleep when you did.
you were sleeping before he went to sleep.
what're you doing?
no, you push yourself with this foot.
keep that foot on there.
what did you do at nursery school this morning?
why do you think that's called a scooter?
I asked you first.
I don't know either.
yes, possibly.
yes, when it goes fast.
I don't know which is better for you.
now push yourself with this foot.
that's right.
you change feet so you can back up?
it takes practice to learn to ride, doesn't it?
that's right.
yes, it only has one.
why would you put two wheels there?
will you see what?
no, I just picked it up.
so that you would not break it.
this is the bow.
you need what to go on it?
an arrow.
not today I don't .
what happened on the train?
what did you do on the train?
we were sitting in chairs and we went out.
when we came back they were beds.
maybe I have something for an arrow.
one of the tinker toys.
alright.
well, pick them up.
well, go get it.
I don't think it's quite long enough to go much further.
it willn't go very far.
hmm?
it doesn't have an arrow.
Robin has some arrows at home.
next time?
maybe if she wants to.
yes, I could bring them next time.

a dozen of eggs.
that you eat?
is that a song?
a dozen of eggs song?
where did you learn that?
did you learn another one today?
what was it?
that's another joke?
Robin had a white mouse.
a real one.
one that crawls around.
a mouse.
Robin has a little cage for the mouse.
yes, a little cage for the mouse.
because he's easier to take care of that way.
no, he sleeps in the daytime and wakes up at night.
mmhm.
animals don't wake up?
what animals wake up in the morning time?
I thought owls sleep in the daytime.
oh?
I don't think so.
what is it now, Adam?
oh, it's cutting grass.
hmm?
what is it now?
I don't know.
what is it?
your bike is wobbly too, isn't it?
careful, Adam, you don't want it to break it.
this is what?
Adam, what is that supposed to be?
you aren't supposed to turn that.
it's not balanced like that.
I'm afraid you're going to break it.
when does it fall?
watch it this time and see when it falls.
why don't you come back a little?
see, it's still up.
see, it's still up.
but it's falling.
now why is it falling?
when you turn the corner what happens?
when you try to turn what happens?
do you know why it falls?
go backwards and see what happens.
why don't you back out?
it doesn't fall off when you go in a straight line.
when you turn the corner then it falls.
what is it supposed to be?
well, why don't you ride it?
show Paul how to ride the scooter.
oh no, you ride it and show him how to ride it.
don't want to show him.
tell Ursula about the story you read.
Hop_on_Pop.
I'll get you some water.
Adam, maybe your fire engine will stay on better.
I don't think that's ever going to stay on.
you know what you might do, Adam?
and what else?
did you tell her that you visited a dairy?
maybe you could tie it on.
do you want to tie it?
need some help?
you will hold it?
no, Paul, no no.
he wants his car, honey.
he was playing with this one.
you didn't have any car.
would you like a drink of water?
I'm sure we can find a car in here.
you hit his finger.
no, you didn't .
I think you hit his finger.
don't do that anymore.
yes.
I don't think so.
he's giving you the other one.
he didn't really knock it down.
because the knots came out.
because the knots in the string came out.
I tied some knots in the string and they came out.
why are you tying it?
no, I don't really think so.
wait.
don't run over Paul.
block.
there are lots of blocks in the basket.
did you find some?
I didn't think you'd notice.
yes, if you'd like to play blocks.
blocks?
alright.
oh no, those are his.
you have to go get some from the basket.
go fill this box with blocks.
it doesn't need to have a top.
because you'll be careful.
you willn't throw them out, will you?
you will so.
I don't think it has a top.
oh, what is that?
oh, what letter is that?
I think not.
see?
it almost shot the wall.
did you tell Ursula about the elephants walking down the street?
was somebody riding on the elephant, Adam?
and what else?
where were they going?
yes, they were going to get on their train.
it took Robin a long time, Adam.
you can't just use one hand.
you have to use two.
there.

oh, that's an animal?
what kind of animal?
an elephant in a train.
what does the elephant do in a circus?
the elephant what?
you know how to do it?
no, you hold this.
oh, you've learned how to do it.

you stand up with some legs.
what did you say?
he didn't sleep well last night.
I think he's getting some molars.
molars.
back teeth.
yes, that's right.
let it rest on your head like that.
no, I don't think I'd like to.
willn't you please go get it?
alright.
I'm sorry.
I was just happy because you were doing such a good job.
do you want to tell Ursula about the museum you went to the other
what museum was it, Adam?
he said a toaster.
oh, you saw the toaster, oh yes.
can you tell her which museum it was?
was it Science Museum?
or the Museum of Fine Arts?
or the Children's Museum?
what else did you see?
a snake.
birds.
a real bird.
did you see some birds that weren't real?
what kind of birds were they?
you don't remember?
hmm?
Adam, does it work with that little bow too?
oh, it's my turn?
yes.
it works.
it what?
what do you think?
at the same time?
well, how are you going to do that?
does that look like a macaroni, Adam?
that looks like an elbow, doesn't it?
where're the peppers?
what's a pepper?
what do you think that is?
why don't you look further inside the bag and see what you find?
I don't know, what do you think that is?
well, why don't you save that for a little while.
oh, I think you can.
you just have to get the paper off.
go ahead.
you're getting it.
that's right.
what happened?
do you have four there, Adam?
how many do you have?
he's not goING To what?
oh, that's a good idea.
each one?
which one goes the farthest?
which one goes the farthest?
and did they have a race, Adam?
let's put them all in one place to start.
did they roll?
who won?
oh, how could they all win?
oh.
what do you have to do to win?
what is that, Adam?
Adam, what about these cars?
aren't these like the cars that Harvey had?
why don't you do one thing at a time?
oh?

I didn't know that airplanes had a horn.
you said beep beep.
who?
what's a full house?
careful, don't break it.
does it turn now?
no, the wheel.
what?
it turns when it's getting ready to go up in the sky.
why did you take my racers?
this is green.
green like the green light.
what does this mean?
how could an airplane go through a tunnel?
how could it?
I don't think it could go under it easily or through it.
what should we say, Adam?
do we go under a tunnel or do we go through a tunnel?
Adam, if we put this here and we all start racing who wins the
how does your car win?
alright, let's try.
and who's the winner?
yours what?
what happens when he has a flat tire?
can he keep on driving or does he have to stop?
he can?
with a flat tire?

no, it got caught in what?
his tricycle.
was it very bad?
it wasn't ?
we had to use the pliers.
no, you couldn't .

alright.
let's play it.
I don't think that's a car.
what do you think it is not?
you don't think that's a truck.
well, I don't think that's a bow.
no.
I think it might be something that flies in the air.
I don't think it's an airplane.
a spear?
no, I don't think it's a spear either.
what else can fly in the air?
a bird?
it doesn't have any wings.
maybe.
you have to do something to it first.
I think perhaps you'll have to put it together in some way.
first you have to find out what it is.
you might not like it.
let's think a little while.
you don't know?
I still think something that flies in the air and maybe you hold
I think so.
you mean unwrap?
she might have that for Robin.
don't you think Robin needs a kite?
put it down.
you play with something else a minute while I get Paul up.
I think you might need some help with that.
so the short wouldn't come out?
what's a short?
what?
what are you going to eat on that kite, Adam?
hi, Paul.
hi, sleepy head.
oh, you're not a sleepy head now?
I think it will.
alright.
that's the first part.
then you have to take it outside on a windy day.
there isn't much wind at all.
perhaps tomorrow.
no, that's a string for what?
why do you need string?
watch the little cars.
you can't ?
oh, you can.
let's see if you can.
he has a flat tire?
oh, he didn't have a flat tire?
what happens when you win?
probably.
careful, Adam.
then what're you going to do with it?
when you use that Adam always shoots it away from people.
oh no.
I think Daddy willn't come in again.
why would you shoot Indians?
I see you've learned how to use it, Adam.
crawl under the bed.
why not?
it's dark under there.
oh, don't do that.
now shoot over toward Paul's bed.
no, because he's not in there sleeping.
where did that go?
what happened?
ok.
over that way further.
see if you can hit the pillow in Paul's bed.
you missed.
what happened that time?
turn it the other way.
yes.

how is it like an arrow?
you don't shoot it with a bow?
oh, do you shoot a spear with a bow?
a long spear?
yes, that's not nice to say.
oh, you silly boy.
what're you doing?
no no, Adam.
careful.
why does it have what on it?
that's a rubber tip so that it willn't do too much damage when it hits.
careful.
you did?
well, you would have hurt yourself.
that's right.
what's soft?
jump on your toe is soft?
what do you mean soft?
the thread out.
because I thought it would be fun to try to knock it down.
isn't that fun?
oh yes.
but it's alright for you to knock it down.
you missed?
yes.
Adam, shall I help you open this up?
oh, an airplane.
these must be what?

no, you do it.
I'm too big.

Adam, how would I know that those are the wheels that go on here?
are those the right wheels?
is this the right wheels?
oh, why isn't that the right one?
oh.
you could use another one.
what does this say?
what letter of the alphabet is that?

I'll be right back.

there we are.
would you like some help to put that together?
is that a bus or a station wagon?
how many people?
oh, count them.
on the other side?
no, nothing on either side that's right.
oh.
like my coat?
that's right.
what?
what you hear?
what do you hear?
it's somebody you know, I think.
how about that policeman?
two colors?
where?
that's right.
why don't you bring the station wagon over here and I'll put it
that's only two wheels.
do you have more wheels?
and do you have one more wheel?
where would it be?
I have three, see?
one more we need.
I'll put it together and you look for the wheel, alright?
alright.
oh, you did?
is that what happened here?
is it alright now?
don't you want to punch some of it out?
why not?
hold it down with one hand and pull it with the other.

keep your finger down.
what're you doing, Paul?
ten wheels!
I don't have any.
not on there.

there's one right by your shoe.
I don't think those sound do.

Adam, don't push him down, honey.
I didn't finish that one.

that's very kind of you.

a chewing boy.
he does what?
here we are, Adamy.
you do?
why don't you play with those things?
here's a place where you can start.
pull that.
take your time.
what does that look like?
a what?
the center pole is wider on one side.
which side is wider?
yes, I think you're right.
is that the loading gear?
I think that can make the yellow thing fly up in the air.
is it a propeller?
but the one on top of the helicopter.
watch, Adam.
you let the whole model go.
no, this is when you want it to fly.
you pull this back.
you let it go after you get it all the way out.
over it?
where does it say let it go?
is that right?

you haven't been there, have you?
yes, perhaps we will later on.
when he was in North_Carolina.
you went to a circus when you came back from North_Carolina.
I'm sure you did.
you got what, Adam?
you saw elephants at the circus?
down Columbus Avenue?
oh no, we didn't see any tigers, did we?
Adam, don't throw sticks.
so you're four years old, is that right?
Ursula asked how old you were.
how old are you?
you don't know.
you shot what worm?
Adam, don't throw the stick now.
I don't have to take any cooking equipment.
what?
has he ever seen you drinking old water?
perhaps so.
what happened?
ok, when you get ready for some more.
what's an octopus?
alright.
in a few minutes.
somebody's unhappy outside.
you are?
why are you unhappy?
Paul, come away from there.
no, before he throws all the toys down there.
Paul, come here.
isn't that what?
Paul, no no.
Paul, stay away away away from there.
are you driving yourself?
that's a grand hat.
that's a very nice hat.
what's a grand hat?
how do you know it's not?
do they come apart?
let me see.
can you fix it?
oh no.
what does that say?
it says four years old.
is that how old you are?
it broke?
that's alright.
why don't you move yours over near mine?
no no, that's far enough.
don't you think?
Adam, you're a silly.
oh yes.
I forgot.
it didn't seem that you needed any.
see what this is.
I suppose so.
Mr Peanut.
he's not peanut butter yet.
Mr Peanut.
just Mr Peanut.
you are, huh.
yes, you did.
let's put it over this way.
alright.

the winner.
Paulie.
I suppose so.
no no, let him have one, dear.
that's alright.
alright.
awoh.
what is that, Paul?
oh my goodness.
yes.
what did you say?
get out of your chair?
how can you play baseball on me?
it's what?
a roller?
you have?
you finish very quickly, don't you?
those are blue.
what are those?
no, you told him he could have that.
oh, the lion jumped through the fire hoop?
good morning.
eyebrows.
that's right.
it's a costume so nobody will know who you are.
come on and put your glasses on and then nobody will recognize you.
oh, you're going to put them on Paul?
come on.
alright.
you don't want anyone to recognize you.
careful, don't step on his finger.
who are you?
a mashed one too.
this is just a small one.
show Ursula.
shall I show you, Adam?
I've got one, thank you.
look at Ursula.
no, we don't .
oh, who is it?
did you ask?
Mr Jones.
no, we don't .
who're you?
me who?
oh.
well hi, Adam.
no, we just don't recognize her.
well, Paul.
you going to put one on?
no.
oh my goodness.
yes, we do.
you do.
there's a blue.
Adam, let him have something.
careful, Adam.
you don't ?
oh, I'm Grace Smith.
no, now who is that?
maybe you better go find out.
you put them on.
I don't have them on.
well, you put them on.
now who are you?
I'm a circus man.
I train the elephants.
no?
she's a circus man?
oh, you're a circus man.
oh.
you look like a deep sea diver.
no no, don't throw it.
I'm afraid you'll forget and throw that.
you don't throw sticks.
that's the kind of mask you wear under water.
he jumped through a hole?
no, you may get hurt.
will you be careful?
it growled.
I'll go get some.
there's something else here to look at.
I don't know what those things are.
why don't you try?
blow it.
a mask.
oh, Paul.
you blow it.
think that's a hat?
you blow it out.
Paul, you're just not cooperative.
Paul doesn't like for me to put it on.
he's going to think that that's Mommy.
I don't think he wants it on Adam.
do I look like your Mother?
that's for decoration.
why would you do two at one time?
oh, where did you see that?
you can make all sorts of things with these.
you can bend it in any direction.
you want to make an airplane?
ok.
here's one for you.
of stripes?
hmm?
that'd be very funny.
yes.
this is a flower.
does it look like one?
a ring?
you could make a pair of glasses.
that's right.
you can always take them apart and make something different.
that's right.
yes, you can keep all these.
why don't you get some of your toys and play with them?
no?
why not?
don't pull.
you'll break it.
thank you.
it looks like it's made out of paper.
I don't think you could take it to the beach, no.
you can make a watch.
that's a very good idea.
here, Adam.
shall we make a watch?
oh, this will?
oh what a pretty watch.
what time is it?
you're in my chair.
alright.
oh, this is your can.
what time is it?
in the morning or in the evening?
he willn't bother you.
he's all tired out.
