yeah, she's telling you she has an old tape player and a new tape
two tapes, you have an old raffif tape and a new raffif tape.
what other tapes do you have?
an Ernie tape and a red tape.
you can write on that if you want to.
do you want to use that pen?
it doesn't look like mine but it writes.
we could do something else.
we could look in here, there's some toys in here.
there's some toys in that bag.
Investigator would let you look in the bag.
do you want to?
yeah?
go ahead.
it's a grab bag.
what's in there?
what is it?
a birdie.
do you want to play with it?
can you put that on your hand?

there are his eyes.
there are his eyes.
how many?
two eyes.
one, two.
there's his nose.
oh, you put your hand right in his mouth.
is he trying to eat the sofa?
that would make a very strange breakfast for a bird .
good morning.
what do you think this is?
I don't even know.
oh, what just happened?

do you think your dolly would like to see the bird?
she's over in the stroller.

I have a little bunny at home.
big bad wolf.
Mommy's here.
Child.
cereal, Cheerio.
oh, that's too bad.
missed it.
the Beast Master.
the president is giving his state of the union address tonight and
you want to drink up the milk?
drink your juice.
more cereal?
you want Chex or Cheerios?
or or both?
Chex.
Cheerios.
Cheerios.
we'd better buy some more Cheerios tomorrow.
um hmm.
milk.
some more milk.
the bug is eating it?
ants eating it.
that's not a bug, that's an ant.
Mommy's corrupting you already.
telling you the wrong names for things.
maybe Daddy should take you to.
which probably was last week or something, so we missed it again.
no, no, that's a week from tomorrow.
today.
P_one today.
yesterday's tomorrow.
which, I'll probably forget anyway.
yeah, Kean'll be here.
maybe I'll take him.
Kean'll be here for the week?
two weeks.
Kean is coming for two weeks?
two weeks, yes.
so you're not going down?
he's just staying?
he's skipping school for two weeks?
no, no, no, this is winter break.
oh, this is normal winter break for him?
yeah.
oh.
I'm not sure if it's one week or two weeks but at least a week.
Child, Kean is coming for a week.
yeah, he knows that.
who's coming on Friday?
do you remember who's coming on Friday in an airplane?
right.
Child.
are you going to Kean how you climbed out of the crib?
are you proud of yourself?
it wasn't so much fun to fall on your head though, was it?
what happens when you climb out of your crib.
do you fall on your head?
actually the second time he didn't land on his head.
oh.
oh.
he's learning to swing his feet around.
what he must do, he must just pull himself straight up and then
that's right.
that's the only way I can imagine.
and once he learns  to rotate around it'll be ok.
it's still a long drop.
he's , that's not that long if he
it's a soft rug.
mmm.
actually if he keeps doing it then I'll know.
yeah, if he keeps doing it we should block off the stairs and
no, that's what I mean, we'll lower the sides so that he can
no, I know that, but I mean also he'll probably just wander around in
unfortunately it's impossible to block off.
oh, the stairway, I think he knows not to go down the stairs by
yeah, you have blue marker on your hand.
that's because you were drawing yesterday, remember?
writing, because you were writing yesterday.
you want to wash your hands?
when you finish your breakfast you can wash your hands.
after breakfast.
actually those markers don't come off as easily as I had hoped.
water soluble, huh?
they say they're water soluble and I tested them out on myself.
I drew on myself and I washed it off and I drew on the table and
but somehow he gets it embedded better.
yeah.
did you wait till it dried before you washed it off or did you do it?
I probably didn't .
I was impatient.
oh.
today's Tuesday.
I don't know, you know your schedule, I don't .
you better go ask her if she doesn't mind waiting until eight.
otherwise I can take Child in.
Observer knows sign language, Child, you can talk to her in that.
where did you learn that?
oh, he doesn't .
Child has a little girl in his class with Down's syndrome. so they do some sign language with her, I think they do.
daddy went upstairs, he'll be right down.
right down.
broken?
what's broken?
a kiss?
that's a kiss broken?
no.
how could a kiss be broken?
you want to a kiss from mommy?

he'll be right down.
right down.
are you all done with your cereal, Child?
you still eating?
careful.
you want to drink up the milk now?
do you want to drink up your juice first?
kisses must be fairly hard to learn.
he just learned them about a month ago.
he still hasn't learned to put them on anybody's cheek or anything.
sometimes if you rush over fast you can get it on your cheek.
they really do melt hearts of stone.
ok, Child, it's hard to drink while you're kissing.
all done with the juice.
all done with the milk too?
all done.
ok, thank you.
can you wipe your hands and face?
then you can go wash your hands if you want.

oh, mommy didn't do such a great job of fixing this.

maybe it just is broken in a bad place.
it's still very mushy.
well, we'll leave it over there.
no, sweetheart, it's still broken.
you can use the comb but not the brush.
no comb?
Child, I'm sorry but the brush isn't working very well.

do you want to read the story?
let's finish the story and then it's time  to get dressed.
ok, now it's time

yeah?
yes.
we have a video camera and so Child's been on tv a lot.
and I was thinking the last time, I don't know if you've ever used
one of the things Dennis did with Child was he just put the camera
and you know when you close the door and it's quiet for an hour and
it's wonderful.
it's a good way to see them on their own.
that's interesting.
hey, that's a nice book.

why don't you show Investigator your books?
maybe you could read a book to her, one of your favorite books.
what would you like to read?
oh, the bunny book.
oh, the bunny book.
ok.
look at those bunnies.
yes.
yeah, that's his bed.

it's flying, Child!
yes, she is, whoo.
oh, I don't want to make you dizzy.
I don't want to make you too dizzy, whoa

Erli.
hi, J_P.
oh, J_P.
soaking up the attention here.
oh, you know what, Child has two different places for her books.

what's that baby's name?
can you tell Investigator?
who gave her to you?
that's a long time ago.
who gave her to you?
no, it was Grandma.
that's why her name is baby Laura, cause Grandma's name is Laura.

that's what you call me.
what's my other name?
what's that name you call me a lot and I have to say to

Child, what's this?
that's okay, you just
oh, that reminds me that I should give you the consent form.
okay.
I wanted to ask you, too, uhm, I forgot to ask you on the telephone.
what I'd like to do is wait until the end to.
okay, that's fine.
to give you the full information
that's fine.
no problem.
just so the interaction as easy as possible.

Child, look, the door opens.
is there anything inside this camper?
hmm?
it has a hose?
hose or holes?
is that a hose?
you know what that is?
that's some kind of steam pipe, I think.
you tell Observer what that is.
you know exactly what that is.
what is that?
that's right.
it is a smokestack?
say, everything with an engine has a smokestack, doesn't it?
uhhuh.
this also has a hook though.
you might be able to hook the camper on the back.
you could try.
let's see.
will it hook?
uh, no, you know what?
this is not a good hook.
in fact, oh, I see, that's the seat.
oh, alright.
well, maybe it will hook.
oh, Child.
yes.
there we go.
she did it, look at that.
now the tractor can go camping.
mhm, silly, huh?
is there anybody driving the tractor?
no?
are you driving the tractor?
maybe Chuck could drive the tractor.
think Chuck could?
or is Chuck too big?
too big, yeah.
who's Chuck?
oh, that's Chuck.
can I see Chuck?
can I look at him?
you need a Kleenex, Child?
shall Momma go get you a Kleenex?
huh?
why don't you stop picking your nose and Momma get you a Kleenex?
does Chuck come out of here or does Chuck only sit in here?
he comes out?
that's a good boy.
I'll let you take him out, cause I'm afraid that I'll hurt him if
let Mommy hold your Kleenex and you take him out.
you tell Observer it's easy to take him out?
it is?
well, can you show me?
sometimes it's hard for little boys.
it's hard.
we thought it was easy but it's hard.
it's easy for mommies and Observers.
it's hard for little boys.
let's see.
now let's see.
see, Chuck comes out when we drop the digger.
I had him tied in for a while cause.
because it was so easy to get him out?
okay.
there we go.
now.
how did Chuck get his name?
do you know that, Child?
I don't know if he knows.
we had our yard landscaped and the guy came with one of these and it
I see.
and that's Child's best toy.
Child, can you tell Observer what that's called?
this?
what is this?
it's not a cement mixer, that I can tell, right?
no.
uh.
and it's not a garbage dumper, is it?
and it's not a tractor, is it?
well, it's not a car, is it?
and it's not a bus.
uh.
Child.
is she teasing you?
you know my knowledge of vehicles is pretty limited.
I bet she doesn't know what it's called.
maybe you can help her.
you're right.
tell her what it is.
cause you know about all the different ones, hmm?
we spend a lot of time watching those.
it looks like it dumps something.

yeah, twice.
it's on at eight o' clock in the morning and five o' clock.
and there are repeats.
the one that's on at five o' clock at night is the same one that's on

yes.
but sometimes they're not because can't understand them.

Child, you remember when we went to New Hampshire and we saw them making syrup?
do you remember that?
we watched them making syrup?
remember the two little girls up there and they had big wheels?
and the man was making syrup in a little house?
and you got to taste it?
and then we brought some home, didn't we?
and we still have it.

that's Observer's tape recorder.
you can't use that one.
you can tell her about the one that you have if you want, but you can't touch hers.
no.
I can't either.
that's a special one.
remember I told you Observer likes to listen to how children talk?
we taped your voice at home, didn't we?
with your tape recorder?
remember you talked, and then we could hear you talking?
the same thing's going to happen in hers.
Child

actually, Child, I brought something new this time.
I brought a book that I thought maybe you and Parent might like to
would you like to see some of the things that are in the book?
there's one page here in particular that I thought might interest
you love books, huh, Child?
look at this?
look.

that is wonderful.
and a bridge which isn't working very well.
we're going to ask Santa Claus for some new train tracks, because this

they have to be taken to the job on a flatbed.
I think Chuck's falling out of his digger, Child.
looks like he's falling out.
can you put him back in?
there we go.
I don't know.
thank you, honey.
I don't know, ask her.
well, it's hard to answer actually because I had a big breakfast.
maybe it's just delicious.
yeah, it's very good, isn't it?
did you have some already this morning?
this is his second breakfast too.
a whole bowl of milk and another bowl of.
huh, Child.
Child, what else do we have.
you want to put the cereal aside for a little while and show
you had a book you wanted to show Observer, didn't you?
oh yeah?
with a lot of pictures in it.
want to go find that book?
that's okay, the cereal will stay right there, nobody's going to take
it's right over there, you can see it.
oh, it's on the bookshelf, your car and truck book.
do you see it?
oh.
it's right at the beginning there.
what?
that's a bulldozer?
little tiny one.
Child, why don't you come over here, that way we can both look at it
little tiny one, yeah.
you did?
was that a good idea?
it was the first and last time he's ever colored.
hey, Child, come around here, that way Observer can see the top of
you sit over this way.
look, otherwise she's going to see everything upside down.
there you go.
now you can tell her all about the pictures.
what happened here?
everything dumped.
it certainly is funny.
I see.

this is a great book.
what's on this page, Child, what's this one called?
you know what that's called.
that's the great old digger.
that's silly, isn't it?
you tell Observer what these are down here, these feet.
stabilizers?
what are those for?
that's right, they go down and up.
that's so the digger willn't tip over while he's digging.
makes them nice and strong.
oh, yeah.
and he's a little too big for the digger, isn't he, Child?
he's a little bit too big.
he does?
ahah.
they do look like eyes.
ah huh.

what's your blanket's name?
what's that blanket called?
special, that's called special.
this is his best blanket.
oh.
well, it has wonderful animals on it, doesn't it?
someone gave him that when he was born for him to crawl around on.

that is great.
do you mow the lawn a lot in here?

no, not right now, hon.
Child.
Child, come here for sec, mom wants to tell you something.
I'm going to get you, I'm going to catch you!
you know why you can't have any now?
because you know why you can't have any now?
because this is like school, do you have a rule in school about no
when you're playing and talking there's no bubble gum, is there?
but when Observer goes home, then you can have a piece.
ok?
can you tell me about some more of these?
remember that I brought a book last time?
oh, we've been waiting, huh.
I don't know if my book is actually as much fun as yours.
but theirs might be some things in here that you'd like to look at.
I think it looks neat.
come and see, come on down.
you can see from up there?
okay.
yeah.
come down here and see.
do you know what this is?
it's not a regular plane.
you know what it's called?
it's a rocket.
it's like a little bit the shuttle, Child.
right, it's a little bit like the space shuttle.
well, the space shuttle goes up in the sky.
remember?
they don't have a space shuttle on here.
they just have this, uh, rocket on here.
oh, look it.
Child, what about this?
know what this is?
what is that?
that's a dolphin?
well, that's close.
it's an airplane.
it's an airplane with a propeller.
and this is an airplane without a propeller.
what does it have if it doesn't have a propeller?
what makes it go?
jets.
jets make it go?
yeah, do you want to see the jets?
this picture has jets in it.
you come down here and see the jets?
here, you can put it there.
here?
see the smoke coming out of the back of the jets?
see that?
what's this one called over here?
you have one of those in your airport.
over over in that, over in that blue box you have one.
watch out for the tape recorder.
yeah, there's something else in there though that's in the picture.
is it a helicopter?
see the helicopter?
yup.
that one has jets.
oh, both do.
they both have jets?
show Observer where the jets are.
oh, that's a jet?
that's where the engines are, that's where the, the smoke comes out
to make the plane and the helicopter go.
the engines were inside this little box, and the the smoke comes out.
no, well it's kind of pretend.
look in the front here.
you see those little lines?
those are the engines.
there's not really a whole engine in there, it's kind of pretend.
yeah.
what are these?
um, here.
yeah.
it comes out the back, the back of the jets, right where your thumb
who's going to go on an airplane next week, Child?
you are?
where are you going?
remember what it's called?
want me to tell Observer?
to Hawaii.
wow.
do you know people in Hawaii?
no?
it's just a vacation?
oh yeah?
yeah.
we're going for a vacation, and we're going to take Karen.
she's going to babysit.
oh.
it's going to be nice.
that's nice.
be gentle.
yeah.
which goes faster?
a helicopter, or a plane?
wooho, wooho!
the airplane, ha, Child.
look at that.
you be gentle now.
ok?
be gentle.
let's see what else we can find in this picture, Child.
yeah.
I wonder whether you know what this is.
do you know what that is?
I don't think so, we've never talked about it.
oh, this has smoke too.
that's probably more like a water jet though.
this is under the water.
that's right, this is called a submarine, Child.
yup.
do you know who used to work on submarines?
Grandaddy did.
he used to be a navigator on a submarine.
Mommy's been on a submarine.
it's really neat.
hmm.
my father was, he was in the Navy.
hmm.
Grandaddy used to work on those, that used to be his job.
well, that's what it was.
his job was to be a navigator.
that means he was driving around.
well, someday maybe we can go on one.
actually we might be able to go on one in Hawaii.
maybe.
or a big boat?
oh, Child, what's this?
yeah, where's it going?
where does the school bus go?
it's funny, in the middle of that picture of all the country, a
mmhm, mmhm.
where does the school bus go?
are you looking for the school?
hmm.
it's not in the picture.
is it?
yeah, right, back in the village.
you're absolutely right.
mommy didn't even see that.
mmhm, mmhm.
no, it's very small.
isn't it.
what else?
did you see this tall thing back there?
I bet that's a church.
because that's the steeple.
hmm.
that could be the school, you're right.
absolutely.
what's this right here that the school bus is about to drive over?
it can't go where?
because there's no street?
well, you know what I think it is?
I think the street's over there but I think we can't see it.
he can go over here.
that's his car and he's going to drive over.
yeah.
why can't he drive over it?
oh, he's not driving it?
I see smoke behind that school bus, you see it all?
tell Observer when we see smoke coming out of cars?
was it
does it have to be warm or cold?
it does?
but only when it's really cold, right?
does Daddy's car make more smoke than the Subaru does?
really?
we've got an old nineteen sixty Mercedes and it starts up and he
but you can't ride in that car, can you?
why not?
really.
hmm, so you can't put in, um, a babyseat either?
no?
you tell, you tell Observer
because Daddy gives him drive rides up and down the driveway in it.
oh, that's a
very special, isn't it?
and one time you went around the block.
that was very special, wasn't it?
which car do you like more, the Mercedes or the Subaru?
he's always liked the Mercedes.
expensive taste for a baby, huh?
ha, Child?
he, the, you know the symbol in the front, we're driving down the
your big Jeep's in the kitchen.
the big one that that makes a lot of noise?
I think it's in the kitchen.
look on the other side of the counter.
over by your tape recorder.
is it over there?
keep walking.
over by the sink, Child.
do you see it?
no, oh.
here it is, sorry, it's over here, Child.
here it is.
it's over by the baby's bed.
did Mommy fool you?
mommy didn't know the answer.
you have money too?
oh, lookit.
oh, what kind of money is that?
mommy money?
good answer, Child.
oh, let's see.
let's see.
gentle, gentle.
what about you
Child, don't throw things, please.
right, don't throw.
don't throw.
why don't you get your tiger and show
it's beautiful.
this is the neatest, this is the most cuddly tiger I've ever seen.
oh, this is wonderful.
she can take it out.
this is wonderful.
this is a great tiger.
isn't he neat?
it's so realistic.
no, in a little while, Child.
you're not going to get it, Child, so you don't have to bother whining.
I know, I bubblegum.
that's my fault because I used to love it all the time.
Child okay?
but you'll have to wait.
alright?
well, if, if you want to go see the.
mommy knows a special place.
but you'll have to wait for a
no.
okay?
why don't we look at this page.
Child, here's some more picture that I thought you might be interested in.
look, what do you see?
I see a lott a new things.
this is a great book.
yeah.
is it like yours?
is it like Daddy's ?
who else is it like?
who who brings a lawnmower to our house?
who comes and mows the lawn?
I do?
no, I don't .
oh, the landscapers.
yeah.
do they mow the lawn with a big lawnmower much bigger than this?
yeah?
do you know what these other things are here?
Grandaddy brought one of these over one day.
what was it?
yeah.
and what did he do with the saw?
what did he saw?
yeah.
the doors, huh?
what's this here?
I don't know if you know what that's called.
firemen use those.
when there was a bad fire, and they could get into the house
it's called an ax.
chopped the wood.
hmm?
does who have it?
Grandaddy has an ax?
yes, he does.
he chops wood with his ax.
firewood for the fireplace.
do you have a fireplace?
where's your fireplace?
what do we do in that fireplace?
no, we don't chop things.
we chop things outside.
do we make fires in the fireplace?
hmm, are they good fires or bad fires?
that's right.
why are they good fires?
because they're not hurting anybody?
hmm.
what do you have up in your room in case there's a bad fire?
goes out the window, doesn't it?
just in case.
well, we're going to leave it upstairs for now.
we're going to, we're going to leave it upstairs for now.
let's see what else is in the picture.
oh, Child, I see some other things that I bet you know.
I bet you know what this is called.
we've got one of these in the kitchen, I think.
what's that?
what is that big thing?
and this.
are those paint brushes?
do you have paint brushes?
what's this called here?
a wrench?
you get the paint off the counter.
run down and show Observer, that's okay you can reach it.
it's right up there.
oh, it's on there, I'll help you.
it's on here.
here it is.
what do you do with this?
a big long one?
that's because he has another one that's this long.
so this one's much bigger, huh?
I see.
I see.
I see.
well, we'll paint another time.
is pretty messy right now.
we show Observer what this is called?
does it look like the one in the book, Child?
yeah.
well, that looks nice.
you must have a good time with that.
oop, you got it.
good boy.
that's right.
what are you missing though?
oop, oop, oh.
no, we don't paint people.
we don't paint people.
do you ever paint yourself?
well, that's good.
I'm glad to hear that.
why, why don't you put the brush back in and let's look at some more?
ok?
because we're not going to be painting now.
we can't paint in the family room, Child.
you want to keep the brush out and we'll close up the paint?
okay.
well, we're not going to paint right now.
Child.
everything reminds him of something else.
yeah, everything.
right.
Child, why don't you show Observer your tape recorder?
she's never seen the kind that you have.
come here.
let me hold the paper.
oh, that's really a nice tape recorder.
pretty nice, huh?
and tell Observer you can tape your own voice too.
you have a little microphone in here, don't ya.
you can record your own voice.
that's what she's doing with her tape recorder.
she's taping what you sound like.
no, we need a special tape to do that.
you can't do it on the regular tapes.
you tell her what this button's for with the tape on it?
what's that button do?
rewinding?
this is so great because now he can get back to the songs he
let me see if I can find the tape that has that part.
this is the only one that you have that will redo recording.
ok?
pushing the buttons on it.
you do, mmhm.
take your time until you get it nice and straight.
you have to put this side by your good boy.
push down really hard.
there, now you can talk.
can talk and see what happens.
you say.
hello, tape recorder.
I already did.
you say it.
say.
hello, tape recorder.
okay, let's stop it and see what happens.
let's see.
see if we hear anything.
that's something different, isn't it?
who is that, Child?
who is that on that tape?
who's talking?
is that Mommy?
huh?
let's look at some more pictures.
yeah, get some more pictures.
Mommy's going to keep this right over here for a minute.
look at this, Child.
do you want to record too while we're talking?
yeah.
let's record while we're talking.
you push record and then you come over and talk about the pictures.
put it right there with Observer's .
put it right next to hers.
that is such a good idea.
there we go, now they're both listening to us talk.
ok?
perfect.
great.
Child, I see a picture of something we found in the wood pile.
what was that?
well, it's something a little bigger than a worm.
remember Mommy was a little scared of it?
what's that called?
a snake.
it scared me, didn't it?
we were bringing in wood for the hurricane and Mummy picked up a
hmm.
and did you come over and look at it?
and then it ran away, didn't it?
Mummy didn't like it.
it was moving, that's right.
mommy didn't think it was moving and you knew it was, ha?
what else did we find in the wood pile?
do you remember?
that's right.
ay, a mouse.
what next?
what?
you didn't ?
only Mommy did.
but you saw its nest, didn't you?
I showed you the, where it was living?
mommy scared it.
why I didn't mean to.
I was bringing the wood in and then the mouse had to run away.
but I'm sure he's back in there now.
because it's a nice warm place for him.
isn't it?
well, we'll go some time.
what about this.
what's this called?
what is that?
yeah and what else?
what's this one here?
we have to rewind it first, Child.
why don't we let it listen to us for a while, while we look at the?
I don't think it's had enough time to listen to us.
put it right there with Observer's .
she's not listening to hers right now.
she's just letting it listen to us.
okay.
okay.
can you see the book from there too?
oh, Child, look.
what are these guys down here?
what are those guys?
I see what they're doing.
they're eating.
what are they eating?
dog food, right.
his babysitter gave him a piece of dog food the other day, he
ha, Child?
Child, I bet you don't know what this is called over here.
I bet you don't know what this is called.
we don't have it anymore, honey.
oh, was it like cereal?

very good.
let's see what else we have in here, Child.

seemed like a good idea.
why don't we not put them on the floor, Child, okay, you usually
Child.
you know why?
you know why?
because they'll get on the rug, and that's not good.
otherwise we'll be putting them away, okay?
if you can't put them on the bucket, we'll have to put them away.
okay?
because your your rule usually is that you have to color up on the

where'd you go with Matthew?
did you go to Ground Round with Matthew?

I think it's quite nice actually.

oh yeah.
I thought the drawings themselves were nice.

a lot of the books that I looked at aren't so clear.
we have a bunch of books by him.
is that yours or Child's ?
no, that was Child's .
oh, we have a bunch of books by him.

what is that?
oh, thank you.
there you go, you show Observer what was in the picture.
there ya go.
oh, which one is that on here?
which one's big?
and which one's small?
oh, this end is bigger than this end.
you're right.
that's called perspective.
well, because this end is closer.
see if we can do it with this rolling pin.
this end is closer to you, so it looks bigger.
and this end is farther away, so it looks smaller.
but they're really the same size.
in this picture they're really the same size too.
you'll learn about that when you get to about fifth grade, Child.
isn't it weird how they notice things like that?
yeah.
that's really nice.
what do we make with that?

he must have been a very little baby then.
he was big enough to make a good mess.
wasn't it?
Child, you have to be really
remember the rule about this?
where does the rolling pin always stay?
on the floor.
it stays on the floor because it's so big and heavy.
you can roll it around with you.
what is that for?
that's for making pies but mommy doesn't use that.
it's for rolling out pie dough so the pie dough willn't stick on the
but Mommy doesn't like that, I just use wax paper instead.

I don't like things with parts.
like all the Fisher Price toys are little people and animals.
let's see, what is it?
that's a dinosaur.
you almost can't buy anything without batteries anymore.
batteries or else it all comes apart.
we used to try to keep everything on the shelves and it's just
my husband got to be fanatic about it.
and finally I said.
what's the sense.
they've got to play with it, and it's all going in baskets.
oh, you've got the elephant.
here's the porcupine.
show Parent the porcupine.
she was throwing it before, wasn't she?
are you going to share it?
doesn't Parent get something?
hoarding everything.
you know what she will do lately that I thought was kind a cute?
if Parent cries or gets hurt she'll offer her her blanket.
Parent doesn't have a special blanket yet.
I don't know why, I guess I just haven't had one for her.
but to her that's really important to give her sister the blanket.
and I thought, well, how sweet to think, well, that'll comfort her.
when she gets hurt she gets her blanket.
she gives Parent her blanket and sometimes her teddy bear.
hi.
hi there, squirt.
they're as different as night and day.
are they?
Parent's very quiet and easygoing and Jamie not now but she gets
she does talk a lot.
what are you doing?
tells me which way to go in the car.
what are you doing?
you better not do that.
you know what?
you might choke.
let's see.
don't pull that thing out, cause you know what'll happen?
all the air will come out of the duck and then he'll be a flat
he willn't squeak anymore.
what's that?
right there with the orange stripes?
seems to me that those were twenty nine or thirty two dollars
ninety six.
what is it?
it's the Kuzoo, the Cabbage Patches' , um, pet, I guess.
oh.
Parent's looking at the book.
maybe you should tell Parent what some of the things in the book
poor Parent.
she's always going to be the little underdog.
oh, boom.
go in there.
I don't think it'll go in there.
where's the porcupine?
he's lost.
I think he's behind you.
what's that thing?
is that Parent's or yours?
it's yours?
oh, let me see.
what toys?
I think she said she had a lot of toys.
I never heard her say that before.
I'll say you do have a lot of toys.

Parent, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

Parent's the one with the handmedowns.

I know.
he can hop through here.
look.
the porcupine can go through the hole.
see?
he's jumping.
can you do that?
do you study their speech or just the way they behave?
speech.
I think it'd be really interesting to study how they behave, but I
you know, I mean they do so many things.
mhm.
you want more toys?
I didn't bring any.
why don't you show me some of your toys?
you want to show her Investigator_one what some of your toys are?
what's Jamie's toys?
Parent's sister is eleven and they play.
it's like I feel it's all I can do to take care of them.
and I was thinking the other day that we don't sit down and.
but like she doesn't know all her colors or her numbers and things.
I know other people who have two year olds.
it's not like they're extra smart.
it's just that people have taken time.
and she will pick up on things.
if you tell her something she'll remember it.
but I just haven't had the time.
I've been so busy with diapers, and keeping everybody clean, that I
well, then I thought that she will pick up on it.
it's a learned thing.
colors are learned and numbers and.
colors, I think, kids really don't get them down until they're five.
they really have a hard time.
are you going to take my microphone?
where are some of your toys, Jamie?
right there?
you've got so many!
you like the porcupine, don't you?
he's sticky.
see his quills?
they'd hurt your fingers if he was real.
see he's smiling.
can you see him smile?
see him smile?
isn't he cute?
he's too big, see?
the other day she was, um, I have a little night light in the
and she said.
Parent, see the light?
see the bear going up the stairs?
she.
like now she's talking in just words but she does say sentences.
yeah, I.
you've said some sentences while I've been here.
I've heard you.
you'll just get used to her and then she'll be gone.
be careful.
you'll choke.
ok, well don't choke on it, ok?
can't Parent have one?
give Parent one to play with, ok?
Parent might cry.
Parent wants a toy.
poor Parent.
porcupine.
you like him?
there's the tail.
that's it.
that's as long as it is.
I don't have any more.
that's all the toys.
want to put the toys in the bag?
no?
oh, alright.
is that your big bunny over there?
behind you?
that yellow bunny?
thank you, Parent.
where's your baby doll?
where is the baby doll?
it's outside?
it better not be outside.
it's cold outside.
she likes those little dolls because they're more easy to manage
she'll take em upstairs and sleep with them.
she's got little dogs and.
my daughter won em at Chuckey Cheese or something.
I shouldn't have said that.
I know you want to go to Chuckey Cheese but.
maybe another day, ok?
you can't do everything at once.
when you're not doing something Parent can do it.
poor Parent.
that's a girl.
here's the boy.
see the girl?
there's a man, and a mommy and a baby and a brother and a sister.
see red?
no, that's purple.
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, grey, brown, white, black.
that's a plum.
that's a mouse.
peas.
strawberries.
peas for Thanksgiving.
those are strawberries.
and carrots.
we'll get them at the store after a while, ok.
what are you going to eat on Thanksgiving?
I should put my turkey out for Thanksgiving.
no, no, no, no, don't do that.
show me the bunny.
oh.
he's cute, isn't he?
how old is Parent?
about a year.
she was a year October first.
can you say.
tape recorder?
tape recorder.
this is called a microphone.
can you say.
microphone?
they're fascinated by things that you wouldn't think.
that's a nice fire truck.
do you know what that is?
where's the turkey?
we have a turkey for Thanksgiving.
there's a turkey.
see the turkey on the door?
oh, you have a turkey?
my mom was an art teacher, and these things.
last year Santa was.
ho ho.
now he's finally Santa Clause.
Santa Clause will be coming, hmm?
you want to see em?
well, he's not here yet.
it's not time.
that's his stocking.
a stocking with toys.
let's see .
no, I don't have any more toys.
I have some paper but that's all.
it's all empty.
see?
it's not very interesting.
what's that?
is that your racoon?
this thing?
yeah, I saw that.
did you cut your hair?
it looks ok.
I didn't tell you my name.
my name is Investigator_one.
can you say.
Investigator_one?
it's a hard name, isn't it.
Jamie, why don't you get one of your books?
want to show Investigator_one one of your books?
there's a pineapple.
pineapple and watermelon.
pineapple?
there's some in the refrigerator.
it's getting cold.
I think Daddy put a can of pineapple in.
can you wait until lunch time?
no?
you're going to have to.
are you ready for a nap?
where's the book?
I think it's right, oops, behind you.
hi there, squirt.
it's amazing that these kids ever make it until they're adults, with
what do you want to find?
look at the giraffe.
it's a big one.
see the giraffe?
careful.
where's the church?
the church?
come here.
see?
the steeple.
there's the church right there.
that's it.
that's the church.
it has to stay in the book.
it has to stay in the book.
you saw Shannon's church last night.
oh no, you didn't .
you were home soaking your fingers.
she touched the curling iron.
the second time in a week that she's touched it.
then the eleven year old gets in trouble and she said.
why.
I said.
you should have told her it was on.
she said.
but it wasn't on, I just turned it off.
I said.
but it's still hot when it's off.
I thought she would have learned, you know, from touching it the
can I see your fingers?
are they better?
they're not better?
which ones are the owie ones?
can you show mommy?
did you burn your fingers?
show mommy where you touched Shannon's curling iron.
are they better?
it's not better?
cut a hole in your pants.
Uncle Doug gave you this sweat suit and it was in real good shape.
don't make it bigger.
I'm going to get you a kleenex for your nose, ok?
Investigator_one.
can you say.
Investigator_one?
don't push her.
poor Parent.
you're mean to Parent.
poor little Parent.
now you're going to give her the horse to be nice.
see, that's how you are.
you're mean and then you act nice afterwards, huh?
right there by the couch.
would you wipe your nose for me?
just a little bit.
here.
I think she's taken notice that I'm here now.
can you pick up?
why don't you get the toys together?
put all the toys on the rug here.
put the toys on the bear.
so when Investigator_one goes she willn't forget em.
you know what?
I think the porcupine is behind you.
right back there.
where's the what?
the truck?
there's two trucks.
where's the other truck?
there they are.
two trucks.
they're driving on you.
they don't fit.
they're the same size.
she's just started singing lately.
she makes up these little songs, and sings aloud.
are you biting that dog?
poor dog.
he's crying.
now she's really convinced.
at least we both know how to whine.
did you hear the doggie?
you're biting his feet.
ouch!
are you going to have a dog for lunch?
where is the other dog?
is there another one?
there's two horses and one dog, I think.
there's only one.
here's the zebra.
that's his tail.
where's the other, where's the elephant's tail?
that's a duck.
that's his wing.
that's another wing.
by his feet.
there's his tail.
that's his feet.
that's his feet.
there's his tail in the back.
there's his tail.
see?
there.
there's his tail.
isn't it funny they know to turn everything to look at the tail?
don't bite it, cause Investigator_one has to take that duck back to
yeah, I have to take him back with me.
and she'll get in trouble.
right.
you want to put him back in the bag for her?
you want the duck.
where's Parent's pacifier?
she's knows what Parent's pacifier is, but for some reason she
Parent's mouth.
cause it goes in Parent's mouth.
mm.
hmm?
you're sharing?
you gave Parent the ball.
I don't know how many balls they went through this summer, because
so we have all these deflated beach balls.
I see something I better take from Parent before Parent.
ahhah.
why don't you give the duck a ride on your boat?
go get your big boat and give the duck a ride on the boat.
that's a good idea.
where's the duck?
now he's lost.
I think he's by Parent's leg.
mhm.
ok.
you going to give him a ride now?
tell Parent you'll be right back.
that's not the boat.
where's your boat?
he looks pretty up there.
you think if you put him there that he can stay here, right?
it's terrible not to be able to have anything on the coffee table.
I can't stand it.
my table cloth is gone, my knicknacks, my cactus, except that
everything is in disarray for years to come.
he can sit right here.
see?
it's a good place for him right here.
why don't you put him on the rug, on the floor, on the bear?
put the boat on the bear on the floor.
oh, that's pretty there.
I like that.
he's happy.
you know when you're around your children all the time you get used
like I told you, for writing she says and I know what
every time you go somewhere, or if you're going to leave em with
she speaks pretty clearly though.
are you biting my duck again?
I have to take that duck back with me.
what if it's broken?
don't break his beak.
don't bite him.
Investigator_one has to.
look, now she's doing what she saw Jamie do.
he willn't fit.
put him in the front.
you forgot that your boat toots, didn't you?
he's too fat?
isn't that funny.
we don't have anything that squeaks and of all things that
they don't have any squeak toys.
he doesn't fit there, honey.
he'll fit right here.
see?
he fits there.
see?
you're too big.
we were on vacation in a big boat.
did you go on a big boat?
did you ever go to Centerville in Toronto?
the little amusement park on the island?
isn't it cute?
we had a nice day.
it was absolutely pouring and we thought, well, we'll go.
and there was nobody there but yet it was still open.
when we were on the train, I said.
oh God please, can't you stop?
this is really bad.
when we got off the train it was finished.
the rain was done and we had a real nice day.
that's great.
went on a big boat.
are you biting the horse too?
you're biting his mouth.
don't bite the horse.
take him out of your mouth, dirty.
you want to go on a horsey?
outside?
we don't have very many places for kids just to ride ponies and
I guess because the insurance is probably so high.
horse or pony.
yeah, I don't know if they have it any more.
what's that?
what's that?
this blue thing?
what do you do with this blue thing?
tell Parent not to touch.
you know it's too bad you're not able to videotape at the same
lulls in the conversation, their actions speak too.
yeah.
we always have the person who came to see the kids do the
but I know you miss a lot.
are most children shy when you pop in like this?
yeah.
which is too bad in a way because even though they're talking.
yeah.
it's too bad you can't do a month's study, just getting friendly
calm down.
phone books and catalogs.
they used to be stacked up very neatly.
oh.
where is em?
in the summer.
it's too cold outside right now.

isn't it funny how books will bring them out?
I think that's all.
it's too cold.
it's freezing.
there's some shoes.
you have some, don't you?
can you tell Parent to get out of there and close the door?
thank you.
there's some more shoes.
yeah?
mm.

my father used to tell us to be careful, that Santa Clause
my eleven year old was talking to her girlfriend the other day and
do you still believe in Santa?
she said.
yes, my mother says if you really believe that there is
and I thought it's really funny they don't really want to give it
that's kind a cute in a way.
it makes you feel really responsible.
they don't tell anybody because they make fun of them.
when she gets older.
Jamie, that book is getting all torn up and you willn't be able to
yeah.
can I have the catalog?
please?
may I please?

oh, I don't think you do.
can you say.
no, what do you do?
can you say, can you ask what she does?
well, what I do with it is, it listens to your voice.
and so when I go home it helps me remember what you said.
oh.
what are you thinking?
what would you like to do?
you like that one?
you want to show her your Christmas bear?
oh, you have a Christmas bear?
oh, look at that!

he's cute!
last week you showed me Bee.
can I see the Christmas bear?
thank you.
oh, he's really nice.
he's soft too.
is there anything you can tell her about the Christmas bear?
what?
can you tell her what he doesn't do, because he doesn't have
so what doesn't he do?
oh.
so what doesn't he do?
no more songs.
oh, he used to have songs in em, huh?
it scares her so she prefers the batteries out
it wasn't because the batteries ran down.
but she asked us to take the batteries out so he wouldn't sing.
she doesn't like that.
oh, he's nicer just quiet.
he's nice and quiet though, isn't he?
oh, there's bl in the, in the buggy.
you're right!
you know what he had on his feet last time I was here?
what?
he had big slippers with claws on the end.
say that again?
somehow that translated to Shalom was sitting on her
and I think it, the claws, she thought of the cat
I see.
I think that was it.
was Shalom reading your book?
honey, I put the book on your shelf.
can you come back in here, please?
I put the book on your shelf if you want your book.
you dropped it?
let me help.
can you pick them up?
here.
very quickly.
can you go back in the other room now, please?
mhm.
is that only book you'd like?
that's the same book we looked at last time.
oh, this is the Noah book!
it's the same book.
you want to sit up here and we can look at the Noah book?
ok.
you must still like this book, huh?
here's another different one she
oh.
there's Noah.
once a very long time ago there lived a man called Noah.
and what's he doing?
yeah.
do you like grapes?
yeah, me too.
do you like green ones or purple ones?
you like both of them.
there, the very next morning Noah and his sons went to the cypress
there they are.
they're cutting down the trees.
and what are they doing?
do you know what they're doing?
what is this thing?
this long thing?
is that called a saw?
yeah.
and they're , they're cutting a tree with it, right?
and look what they did.
when they cut it all in pieces it looks like that.
it doesn't look like a tree anymore, does it?
it looks like boards.
yeah.
what are they doing there?
what are those, what are those women doing?
yeah, you remember some of the words.
look at that.
do you think they built that all by themselves?
look at that.
that's so big.
yeah.
and what goes in that boat?
yeah.
who, who goes in it?
some of the animals go in, right?
and some people?
let's see.
look what they're doing, they're filling the boat up with food too.
cause they're going on a long trip.
yeah.
look at these animals.
what kinds of animals are there?
two of everything, right?
what are these?
these two?
right.
you have two bears.
and what are those?
do you know what those are?
what?
right.
do you know what those are?
that's a hard kind of animal to know.
what is that?
these two?
very good.
I bet you don't know what those are.
what are those?
they have bumps on their back.
yeah.
they're called camels.
and lots of different kinds of birds.
I don't know what the birds are.
ok.
let's , let's go to the next page.
Noah opened the door of the ark and two by two the animals hurried .
when all had been done as God had ordered, Noah closed the door.
look at all those animals.
rain began to pour down.
creeks became rushing rivers.
rivers flowed into lakes.
lakes joined to make a great ocean.
and the ark was lifted off the land.
look at that.
there it goes.
I think they're all closed up inside so they don't get wet anymore.
you, you've been rained on?
did you get wet?
in all the world nothing was left but Noah, and his family, and the
look at that!
there's Noah and everybody on that big boat, all by themselves on
they're all inside there, nice and dry, eating, eating all the
what do you think they eat?
do they
the horses eat hay, right?
and maybe like
maybe the giraffes and some of those animals eat hay too.
what do you think the bears ate?
they eat hay too?
maybe they had to cause there wasn't a lot of other kinds of food.
maybe they ate grapes, cause, remember, Noah was picking grapes.
look at that.
they're all inside swimming around.
do you have a tissue?
I'm really.
coming in from outside.
thank you.
can I get you something warm to drink?
no, thanks, I'm all set.
look at that.
the ark was noisy and crowded.
and Noah and his family were kept very busy.
they brought food and water to the animals.
they swept the stalls and cleaned the cages.
look at that.
you know what that looks like?
it looks like a big zoo.
a zoo in a boat.
and there they are.
they're landing now.
they saw a bird.
the bird is finding some land.
now they're on land again.
they're still in there.
maybe it'll show us a picture of them coming out.
do you think it'll do that?
let's see.
ok, they're on land.
and Noah's looking up at the sky.
oh, there're the animals.
they're all going to come out.
yup, they're all
see?
the land is outside now.
it's all nice and dry, so they're all going to go right out there and
yeah.
I think that's
oop, there.
that's where they live now.
what are these two?
yeah.
they're all nice and pink.
ok, I'll , I'll read
ok, this is the last part, ok?
on that day a beautiful rainbow appeared and God spoke to Noah.
God has sent that rainbow as a promise said Noah.
he will never send another flood to wash the world away.
from now on whenever we see a rainbow in the sky we will remember.
see that rainbow?
Noah and his wife and sons and their wives built new homes and
in time the earth was filled with people once again.
look at that.
are they sleeping?
am I going to go home now?
not not yet.
not for a little while yet.
excuse me?
they're going to get rained again?
is that what you said?
that's what I heard.
what do you see?
did we have a Christmas tree this year?
I took my Christmas tree down too.
it was getting all dry, wasn't it?
yeah, I left mine up for a long time.
and then the needles started to come off and got on the floor.
so I took it outside.
yup.
but first I took all the, the shiny things off.
hmm.
there goes the truck.
mhm.
what did you have on your Christmas tree when it was up?
do you remember?
do you remember?
what?
yes, your toys are in the toy box.
do you remember what we hung on the Christmas tree?
maybe you can't remember.
it was in the other room?
can you show her where it was?
yeah.
show me where it was.
can you show her where the Christmas tree was?
you're a little rabbit.
ok, I can read a little bit of it, and then Mommy can read the rest.
is that good.
yeah, I, I knew that you'd want to be up.
ok.
this is a library book, right.
yeah.
once there was a little bunny who wanted to run away.
look at that!
there's the little bunny.
he's a rock.
yeah, he's a rock bunny.
yeah.
look!
there's his mom!
looking for the little bunny!
see em?
that's a nice story.
can you have mommy read you that one?
oh, can I read it?
where are you going?
go get another one.
can you get the Edith book?
we were in the middle of that one.
shall we read that one?
can you get the one about Edith?
what's this one?
ok, we can look at this one too.
we were in the middle of that one, so
oh, ok.
oh, look at that.
Christmas is coming.
said Edith
why don't you have Mommy read to you for a little while?
I want to hear Mommy read to you.
will you sit in my lap?
so what did Edith do?
I told you so.
that's what he said.
Edith's favorite present was a hood of real fur.
mhm.
and she had an idea.
you had an idea?
what was your idea?
oh, that's a phrase you like to say a lot, isn't it?
you mean, what mufflers.
exclaimed Charles.
we'll think of you every time we wear them.
well, I think the one with the glasses is Charles.
see his glasses?
I think that's Charles.
mhm.
the end.
that was a nice story.
I liked that.
I think we've read enough.
want to do something else now?
you just heard this story.
you want to hear it again?
you're a funny bunny.
should we start at the beginning?
ok.
Christmas is coming, said Edith.
so Edith stopped crying, and thought instead.
she had an idea.
what?
is that my coat?
mhm.
what, what about your coat?
where's your coat?
oh, we're going to read some more?
here, why don't you come back up?

would you like to go get you notebook and draw instead?
quickly?
oh, remember what you made last time when I was here?
a purple and blue candy cane.

I wasn't sure if we did this last time or not.

I better help.
let's get the big notebook.

let's put the notebook on the table, and I'll come sit on the floor.
ok?
there.

yes, you just it.
Observer.
mhm.
can you tell her what your name is?
mhm.
hey, that looks good!
should I make a candy cane on the same paper?
ok.
this isn't a good example here
over here.
can we eat it?
it would taste like crayon and paper though.
there.
here, I don't think you should draw on top of this book, cause if
do you like to color?
what are you making now?
are you making something different?
what are you making now?
a candy cane.
that's the same.
that's not different.
well, how about if I break it in half and you have half and I have

ok.
mhm.
that's nice, isn't it?
ok.
what do you say?
you're welcome.

I have to make a knife.

would you pet her?
and usually unsupervised is when it really happens, so
sometimes it's Child being mean, and sometimes it's Shalom being
what are you looking for in there?
I think it's empty.
she said it's empty.
that means there's nothing in it, right?
well, do you see anything?
oh, I know what's in there.
it's not very interesting though.
do you know what this is?
this is, I can put it on my tape recorder when my tape recorder runs
but the tape recorder doesn't need it now.
so can I put it back in the bag?
no?
say yes .
I think that's a good place for it.
I'm going to wind it all up so it doesn't come unraveled.

are you a mountain?
yes, Child?
how's it doing?
okay, come here in the light where I can see it.

it might be a splinter.

the horse fell off, huh?
did you put the lights on?
maybe the battery doesn't work.
can I try?
nope.
nope.
I think.
what happened to the batteries, Child?
he has to have magic power, I think.

so they can crawl underneath?

I don't know if I can but I'll try.

I see those batteries but I bet cha they don't work.
should I take em out?
I don't think you can tell by looking.
they just don't work.
ok, in they go.
oops, I think this one has to go in this way.
there.
oh, I made a mistake.
ok, sorry.
are you sure it goes like that?
how come it's not closing then?
I should take em out?
what if I try turning
oh, maybe you were right.
maybe it does go this way.
oh, I think that'll do it.
there.
there.
bravo.
I don't think they work.
I think you need different batteries in there.
because sometimes we put the lights on and then we forget to turn
the wheels work good.
yeah.
what?
how many wheels are there?
where's five?
one two three four five six.
maybe we should give the porcupine a ride.

I want a ride.
bring the fire engine over here, Child.
there, now take em for a ride.
and then bring em back and we'll put the elephant in .

he's got those sticky things on em.
we never saw a porcupine before, did we?

woo.
now can the elephant have a ride?
he's like Dumbo flying through the air, isn't he?
there.
did you see the Dumbo movie?
no.
did we read about Dumbo in your book?
poor Dumbo cries, didn't he?
why did he cry?
did everyone make fun of Dumbo?

I'm going to put it right there.
do you want to show Mommy the book?
yeah, let's see.

yeah.
what do you put in that little slit?
what goes in there?
yeah.

it's a scooter.

and then you push with the other foot.
and you go along.
what's this?
that looks like something you have in the back yard.
right.
you have a sand box back there?

tell Investigator what you made in your sand box yesterday?
what'd you make?
what did you make and Mommy helped you?
what'd you make?

you have one of these.
what's that?
a top?
um, what do you like to play with on this page?
which of these toys do you like?
that?
that's a pogo stick.
yeah, you put your feet on here and you hold on here and then you
it's fun.
yeah.
maybe in a few years.
I think you're a little too small for that.
but it is fun.
mommy used to like to play on that.
we had one of those.
we liked it.
did you have that?
no, I remember going to people's house that had em and I thought
but I never had one.
oh, you were deprived.
yes.
I had stilts though.
stilts.
we didn't have those.
our nextdoor neighbor did.
I loved stilts.
yeah, those were great.
these are stilts.
right.
you walk on those and then you can be high.
like the man at the circus.
did Child tell you we went to the circus on Saturday?
did you go to the circus?
did you?
did you go up real high?
tell Investigator what else you saw at the circus.
what did we see?
lions, right.
what else?
no, we didn't see any dinosaurs.
you have dinosaurs on your tummy.
oh, he wants to wear that belt every day now.
yup.
look at all of these things.
what do you like on this page?

me too.
what else?

you eat it with this syrup.
what are those?
right.

and what are these that the train goes on?
what's that called?
you know.
what are those?
the track.
that's the coal car.
you know.
what is it?
right.
that looks like a race car.
what's this?
right.
oh and then he's going to pick that up in the air?
oh, that's a good idea.
oh boy.
so all the things on the page are going to be hooked together.
and then the crane is going to take it way up in the air?
oh, I can't wait to see that.
that sounds exciting, doesn't it?
what are all of these things?
what's that?
yes.
that's a little village, looks like.
there's a barn.
oh, those are all things that we have in the house.
do you know what all these things are?
right.
what's that?
right.
what's this?
is it going round, and
well, after it listens to us for a while and I'm going to take it back
huh?
hi.
what's what?
these?
I think Child has an obsession with feet.
see that?
I got a foot booboo.
oh.
I kicked the steps and I got a bruise on my toe.
that was dumb, right?
I thought so.
thanks a lot.
let me see.
your feet are all covered up.
this isn't fair.
can you show Investigator your toes?
he's so funny about his feet.
he never wants to have his feet exposed.
really?
like the minute I remove his dirty socks, I have to put on clean
he never wants to go barefoot.
that's amazing.
I know.
I don't know why.
and he willn't let me cut his toe nails.
you have special feet in there, right?
you're keeping them
sacred.
yes.
where are these shoes from?
I don't remember.
some store.
what are those called, Child?
what did Mommy tell you shoes like that are called?
sandals.
right.
do you have any sandals?
no?
cause you don't like to have your toes exposed.
someone gave him a pair and he wouldn't wear them.
he like cried the whole time he had them on.
that's really interesting.
what?
you have little boats on your socks.
yesterday, what?
what were you going to say about yesterday?
did you play under the sprinkler yesterday with the hose?
you want to spray on Margot.
oh.
did she like that?
did she?
I bet cha she got mad.
no?
she didn't get mad?
you played on the carpet?
you sprayed on the carpet?
no, you didn't .
he wanted to.
I see.
he has an active imagination.
right.
we didn't even see Margot yesterday.
who's out there?
where are those children from?
oh.
can you tie your shoe?
alright.
show me how.
right.
that's plastic on there so you can put it through the holes.
you know there's a name for those things.
I can't remember what they're called.
is there really?
yeah, I saw on tv or read about it.
I said to myself.
I'm going to remember what those things are called.
it's the kind of thing they'd ask on a game show.
right, it was.
it's something like Niglet or something.
really?
yeah, something like that.
so come on, Child.
do you want to look at some more of these pictures?
no?
you're bored with this.
ok.
you're busy with your shoes now.
alright.
oh, I could get the rest of the toys out.
I forgot I had other toys.
ah.
what's that?
ah.
ah.
who's that?
do you remember the name of that guy?
what?
what is it?
what's he called?
what is he called with these pricky things on em?
is that a porcupine?
oh, look what Investigator has.
remember what this is?
what?
what is that?
he's jumping on your foot, helping you remember.
does he say woof woof?
oh, he crashed.
oh oh.
oh oh.
you better get em out of there.
are you from the department of psychology?
yeah.
oh.
well, actually I'm in psychology and linguistics.
oh really.
yeah.
oh.
there it goes.
crash crash.
oh.
what a great coffee table.
it was my creation.
it's an old sewing machine.
yeah, it's neat.
thanks.
I'm sure it provides hours of enjoyment for Child too.
he loves it.
I think it's stuck.
now what.
yay.
you're going to go the other way?
ok.
oh, that's like a tunnel, isn't it?
oh, is that the Duffy school back there?
yeah.
oh, I see.
I think they work with the U of R too.
do they?
the psychology department because they do counseling of students.
right.
that's probably right.
it's nice having that playground.
mhm.
do you play on it sometimes when those kids aren't there?
yes.
oh, are you ok?
youch.
can you tell Investigator which what rides you go on at the play?
what do you ride on?
and what else?
the swings.
what else?
the horse?
the bunny and the bumblebee?
yeah.
it says bumble bumble?
you're funny, Child.
yeah.
what is this study studying?
oh, I'm interested in how parents and children talk.
and I'm mostly interested in, um, do you, like, does he imitate you.
that kind of thing.
oh.
I'm interested in the language aspects.
yeah, he repeats everything.
I think he's stuck.
I don't think he can fit in there.
it looks a little too small.
he could go through that tunnel again.
that's another kind of tunnel.
that's a tunnel too.
lots of tunnels there.
that's a little tiny tunnel.
mhm.
no, I don't think he can fit, do you?
that's the axle of the wheels.
where's the motor?
oh.
yeah, that's like a hill.
you keep bumping your head.
poor guy.
are you going to lie down?
probably that's a good idea.
keep you head out of the way.
where's Child?
oh, there, I see his eye.
do you see Investigator over there?
oh, they must be hiding.
they're in their garage.
right.
they can see you?
can you see them?
watch your head.
oh, that's a tunnel under there too?
oh, I thought that was the garage.
oh boy.
watch your head.
watch out.
oh.
what do those trucks make?
in that red part on the back?
what do they mix up in there?
yeah.
you know.
what are they called?
cement mixer.
right.
that's where they mix the cement in that back part.
and then they dump it out to make sidewalks.
mhm.
that's a wheelbarrow?
oh.
that's right.
and then they take the wheelbarrow full of cement and pour it.
did you ever see anyone do that?
that's the garage?
I have to get Simon.
I can see him winding up here.
ok.
here comes Simon.
what is that?
that's a collie dog, remember?
and you know what?
last time you named him Wolfie.
right.
that's right.
remember Wolfie?
yeah, I know.
but Wolfie wasn't a dog, was he?
what was Wolfie?
maybe that's why he wants to keep his toes covered.
maybe.
no, this was before that.
this all started a long time ago.
that would convince me to keep my toes covered.
um, what kind of an animal was Wolfie?
was he a dog?
no.
what was he?
what was Wolfie?
did he fly?
didn't he have
what color was he?
tell Investigator what he looked like.
was he green?
you know.
don't open it.
I think there's stuff you don't want to touch in there.
no, that's
what is that?
it's the fireplace.
you know, Child.
these are all things you know you're not allowed to touch.
that's the poker.
the poker.
well, let me see which one you're pointing to.
is that the broom?
then why do you ask me?
Simon has really black hair.
I know.
he had a lot more.
he's lost a lot.
that's the poker.
 and the other one is called the shovel.
no, that's the poker.
that's the poker.
you'd better put that back there, kiddo.
put that right back, Child Ralphy.
we poke the logs around to make the fire go better.
let me see.
that's the broom.
to sweep the ashes away.
that's the shovel.
that's to shovel all of the ashes into a bag and throw it away.
now why don't you come over here and not touch that anymore.
you know what it is.
why don't you come over and say hello to Simon.
yeah.
Simon wants to say hello to you.
you know what that is.
come on over.
Simon's looking for you.
no, you can't bang on there.
I don't think that's a good thing to bang on.
no, it's not.
Child, please, stop that now.
Investigator doesn't like it when you do things like that.
I don't , I don't like it.
it's too noisy for me.
yeah.
what are those?
that's the old porcupine.
mhm.
I don't know.
you're Mr Curious today.
Mr Curious.
are you Curious George?
do I want to go to the zoo?
this afternoon?
well, I'd love to but I really can't .
I have to get back to school.
Investigator goes to school too, Child.
are you a graduate student?
actually I just finished my Phd.
oh, you did?
congratulations.
yeah.
thanks.
I'm just here for another month and I'm going down to City.
I took a postdoc in City.
oh, that's great.
what?
I don't understand.
do you want me to tie your sneaker though?
ok.
I'd be happy to do it.
should I do it?
why don't you let Investigator do it?
let me see if I can do it.
sometimes I have a hard time and I want to see if I know how.
should I try?
ok.
I'm making the loops.
ok.
did I do it right, you think?
does that look like
I think that's it, right?
that looks good.
it looks kind a like the other one.
should I put a knot in it?
ok, that's a good idea.
then it'll look just like the other one.
it'll have a fat knot in the middle.
there, now they look just alike.
pretty good, huh?
see, that ones's got a knot and that one's got one too.
so you want to go to the zoo today, Child?
is that the idea?
was that a hint?
what would you see if you went to the zoo?
what would you go and look at?
what about the monkeys?
I love the monkeys.
what?
what?
you want to come on the what?
on the platform?
what platform?
oh, you mean where the elephant was?
they had a platform and you could climb up on the elephant.
oh.
but we didn't let Child do that.
probably a good idea.
because he never would've gotten
you know what that book's about.
you've seen that book.
oh, what's that?
wait, I just saw something that we just talked about last night.
what's that?
is that the castle?
who lives in the castle?
who did Mommy tell you?
the king and queen?
they live in the castle.
remember?
in that other book that we have it showed the picture of the king.
and what do they wear on their heads?
remember, they had those pointy things?
what were those called?
crowns.
you want to want to wear a crown?
and you could be King Child?
he thinks he is already.
that's Investigator's book.
don't bend it like that.
that's not nice.
what did Mom tell you about books?
books are like friends.
you should treat them nicely.
yes.
do you want to go?
do you have any books you want to show me?
you want to show Investigator your books?
oh, the ginger bread man.
oh, I remember.
no, I saw that someplace else.
he was afraid of it so I hid it.
oh, I know.
Margot has the Ginger Bread Man because I had to read it to her, the
really?
what?
there's a cow.
yeah.
the ginger bread man got a little ride on the cow?
or no, he didn't get a ride on the cow, he just saw the cow.
what did the ginger bread man say to the cow?
run, run as fast as you can.
you can't catch me.
I'm the ginger bread man.
yup, he went to the cow.
I was afraid of that book too, I think.
because at the end the fox eats the ginger bread man.
I know.
no, really a lot of those books are like that.
the three little pigs and
I know.
Little Red Riding Hood.
the Grimm's fairy tales are really awful.

they're so funny, aren't they?
as soon as you say something it's like ok, let's do it right now.

I want to see a truck.
you don't want to see a truck?
she'll go with you.

oh, he's a riot.
great.
he's funny.
it's so interesting that they have such distinct
oh yeah.
it's amazing.
I know, I was surprised too.
you think of them as generic at this age but they're really all
what's the story here?
are you feeling a little aggressive?
I think so.
yeah?
you certainly did move them.
what's this thing?
is this part of Leggos or something?
mhm, Duplo.
Duplo.
it's Leggos for little children.
are those good?
did you offer Investigator any raisins?
she didn't want any?
no.
I don't blame you.
he's probably touched all of them.
so you want to go get me a book now or do you want to pull the wagon?
you know, I came to visit you and you have to entertain me.
yeah, like Mommy has to entertain you all the time.
now you have to entertain Investigator.
yup, it's a big responsibility.
what are you doing, drying the raisins in the sun?
giving your raisins a ride?
oh, that's good.
bye, raisins.

um, January twentieth, eighty five.
oh, right.
I think I already asked you that.
I'll write it down.

oh.
you're a hundred?
oh, my goodness, you look young for your age.
are you three?
are you one?
oh, you're not one cause you're two.

that says five hundred words to grow on.
I think we had a little raisin spill over there.

there's some right there.
that's good.
oh, you know, I don't know if that's a half hour tape.
no, it's a
this session is an hour anyway but it's forty five minutes on a
oh, oh.

what's happened there?
who did that?
who bent the book like that?
what was that boy's name?
some little boy did that.
I don't know who did it.
was it Simon?
oh, you.
yes and then it looks fine, doesn't it?
is the mail man here?
I think he was coming when I was pulling in the driveway.
oh.
I saw the mail truck.
oh.
Simon is losing hair at a rapid rate.
that's funny.
every time I touch em I get hair all over me.
you poor guy, you're going To be a baldy.
oh.
well, why don't you give those animals a ride?
what about that horse and the collie?
they might want a ride.
what is that horse's name?
what's his name?
his name is donkey?
and what's the dog's name?
hmm?
is it Lassie?
what about the porcupine and duck?
they might want a ride too.
this is like the happy man with his dump truck.
what happened in that story?
he had a truck?
right.
and who went in the dump truck?
all the animals, didn't they?
and then what did he do?
he gave them a ride.
oh, poor Simon.
and what happened when he tipped up the dumper?
what did the animals say?
they said.
wee, this is fun, this is like a sliding board.
I think everybody's in there now.
oop, they dumped a little.
oh oh, everyone fell out.
yup, they're all on the floor.
do you go to school, Child?
he wants to go to nursery school.
yeah?
in September.
oh.
where're you going to go?
where?
I see the horse.
where is he?
I think the horse is a little too close to the fire place.
oh, better go get em before he gets burned.
see em?
go get em.
no, don't turn that.
this is a funny tape recorder because you can't listen to it unless
oh.
it doesn't have a speaker in it.
can you tell Investigator what things we saw at the nursery school?
what'd you see?
what did they have there?
mmm.
wow, it sounds like fun.
are you
does it look like Wolfie?
ah, it does, doesn't it?
only he willn't peck your sneakers.
did he?
don't touch that, please, Child.
Child, please, don't touch that.
no, don't touch it cause it willn't make any noise anyway.
yeah, it's a machine.
is that what you said?
you want green?
what do you want?
something green in there?
where's the green thing?
there's a green hole there, right?
the green hole is where I put my headphones in but I don't have the
the headphones are like ear muffs and they go over your ears and I
yes.
yes, yes.
so what else?
tell Investigator more about nursery school.
well, we're not going till the end of the summer.
you can go outside pretty soon cause I'm going to go home.
then we'll go outside, ok?
and you can play in your sandbox.
oh, that'll be fun.
ok.
don't want to get it dirty?
you're going to get water in your sand box?
yeah.
no?
ok.
look what Investigator did with the barrels.
shall we make it fall?
ah.
hey, watch it, Bud.
don't hurt Investigator.
I see you knocked those down.
be careful now.
don't hurt her.
ok.
wait till I'm done though.
I want to get my hand out of the way before the destruction comes.
ok.
ok.
there you go, Child.
knock it down.
boom.
that was one shot and they all went down.
alright.
remember though, wait till I'm all done.
ok.
yeah, that devilish laugh of Child.
you think that's funny.
ok.
there they are.
oh, they fell over all by themselves that time.
the dinosaur belt.
the mighty dinosaur belt.
there they go.
we could go bowling.
look, we can see if we can knock em down with the other one.
hey.
do you want to do that?
oh.
you would rather use your dinosaur belt.
hey.
are you trying to hurt Investigator?
that's not nice, Child.
ok.
so what's , Child, what's Simon?
is he your, is he your father?
yo, Child.
Child, Investigator is asking you a question.
what's Simon?
is he your father?
what is he?
is he your sister?
what is he?
what is he though?
he's Simon?
but what is he?
he's your little
what?
you know.
no but what is he?
and you're his big
right.
and he's your little
don't swing that belt around, please.
do I have to take it from you?
then please stop it.
if you do it again Mom's going to take it.
yeah, I think that's not a good thing to do.
cause it's stretchy and when you let go it springs back and it
it hits your face.
and then you would cry.
so it's not a good thing to do.
yeah and if you hit me I'd really cry.
I'd cry so much.
ah.
Child!
maybe you should put it back on.
yeah, why don't you put it on?
cause I think it looked nicer with it on.
I did too.
it was a real fashion statement.
what did I say about swinging that?
alright, I'm taking it.
there it goes.
no.
can you hold it nicely or put it around your waist?
then do it.
not your wrist, your waist.
this is your waist.
around your belly.
put it on.
let's put the buckle in the front.
are you trying to buckle it in the back?
you want me to do it?
alright.
yeah, I think that's a good idea.
it looks like you're chasing your tail.
I know.
now don't take it off again or I'm going to take it away.
I'm going to put it upstairs in your drawer.
oh oh.
ok, give it to me.
yes, you've had enough warnings.
yes.
see what happens?
then give it to me.
then put it on your waist and don't remove it again.
let me see the belt.
oh.
I'm going to have to get ready to go home pretty soon.
do you want to help me put my toys away?
ok.
where are they all?
you have em down there in your little wagon, I think.
oh, here's the wagon with all the toys.
and don't forget the horse by the fireplace.
yup, don't forget my horse.
thank you.
there he is, all warm.
there goes the duck.
there goes the elephant.
is that everybody?
was that all?
oh, what about those trucks, those cement mixers?
where are those?
he was probably trying to hide those.
oh, the zebra.
oh and the zebra.
I forgot all about him.
he'll be sad.
he would be all alone.
thank you.
thank you.
what about the book?
can you fit that in there too?
bombs away.
ok.

I think it's either a dog or a wolf.
I think it's a dog.
it's a collie dog.
do you think it's a dog?
yeah?

did you see one of those at the zoo?
you were going.

would you like to build blocks?
well, pick up the porcupine.
ok, you can put em where you want.
oh, you have a special place to put blocks.
this is well worth its weight in gold.
these winters are so long.
I was telling my husband that my Lego skills are improving and it's
Child, you want to get the blocks for me?
let's do Legos.
I like Legos.
yeah.

I don't know.
I can't tell.
now these little ones only fit on the ones that have open spaces.
they willn't fit on the other ones.
I see.
that's the difference between Legos and Duplos.
they fit on these.
mhm.
does it go on there?
well, let's try this one.
like this?
well, it willn't go on that way.
you have to turn it around the other way.

I think the girl's going to have to stand on this thing and have the tv be someplace else.

can this be the tv set?
I don't know how to do this.
oh, I've got it.

his tail fell off.
oh dear.
it's garbage, yeah.
all done with that, huh?
all done with that.
it's garbage.
I don't think so.

you were in those babies.
is that hard work, Child?

hi.
you too?
there's Mommy and Child in the box.
oh boy.

where'd it go?
it's right here.
oh, who do you hear, Child?
is that your chickie?

I think the bunny baby came on.
his nose is moving.
he's tickling me.

oh, my nose!
your nose.
did he get it?
can he get your belly?
oh, he's tickling me.
oh, he's kissing it?
oh, thank you.
yes, he's a very nice bunny, sweetie.
oh, where'd that bunny go?
he's in a bunny cage.
I guess so.
you are?
that's a tough box.
I see that.
I think you've got em in a cage.
do you hear em?
what's he doing in there?
is his nose moving?
you going to let em out?
no?
poor bunny.
I think bunny's stuck in there for the rest of the day, unless you
I don't know.
you show me.
you show me.
find him.
he is?
big sigh.
is it time to wake him up?
I see that.
I do too.
he must be awake.
he looks like he wants to get up.
Child has better ideas.
oh boy.
he is?
is he hiding?
oh dear.
what are you doing?
I'd rather you didn't .
why don't you sit down, please.
Child.
I don't know if that box is going to hold you.
sit down.
you did hide the bunny.
oh, poor bunny.
poor bunny.
he's being hammered?
I know.
do you think he likes that?
it might be noisy in there.
what are you building?
ok.
what kind of house?
a red house.
now what are you going to hammer?
the ball?
oh.
oh oh, poor chickie.
you'd better hammer gently.
can you do it gently?
soft, yes.
you're going to color me?
what color am I going to be?
I am?
that's pretty bendable, huh?
now it's crooked.
uh uh, don't hammer on the speakers.
bye.
slide right off the end.
I figured you'd like that.
oh, she fell down.
right off the box.
what did you hurt?
oh.
do they need kisses?
that's a good box.
you can do everything with it.
you're trying, huh?
now maybe it willn't wiggle anymore.
I hear him.

on the other side?
he's got eyes.

I like him.
he's a nice toy.

could you take your nookie out of your mouth, please?
it makes you look like Bozo.

is that a zebra or a horse?
okay, I think I'm going to keep taking a few out.
how about this horse?
that's too small to be an elephant.
how do you know that's an elephant, honey?
you're right but how do you know?
because of the trunk?
uhhuh.
how do you know this is a duck?
because it squeaks?

it says it on the bottom.
oh!
it's a, that's a tractor?

tractors don't have roofs.
it's a Zetor tractor for whatever difference it makes.
I guess that means it has a roof.
does it have a roof?
can you show me the roof?
look.

what other things do you think, Investigator.
why don't you ask Investigator what other things he has.
yeah.

fishes have tails.
you think it could be a
a nion?

they might.
now is that a zebra?
why might they all fall down, honey?

that's the first zebra, right.
at least she's consistent.
well, that's a zebra but I don't think that's really a zebra.
do you know why?
I think it's a horse.
I think it looks a lot like this horse, see?

you see this dice here?
can you give me one with the same color as that?
which one?
is there another one the same color as this one?
you'll try to find one?
not the same size.
no, I, I think it's completely beyond.
I don't think.
do I need that one?
yeah, I do need that one.
aren't those nice?
those are really something!
do I have another one?
let's see.
let's see what I have.
it should be in here someplace.
you know what, look at that.
a pencil.
oh!
you did, look!
did he have another one?
how many are there?
how many are there?
how many?
how many?
oops!
they're very easy to lose.
yeah.
did you see where it went?
do you want to get up, Child?
stand up so we can see where it went.
got it.
okay.
they're actually not that easy to lose, especially if they're red.
do you think I might have another one?
why do you think that?
how many?
how many are there now?
how many is that?
and that?
and that?
and that?
how many is that?
that's three.
how many is this one too?
and how many are there all together?
how many are there all together?
how many red ones?
how many black ones?
how much is two plus two?
where?
I don't know.
I can't see.
how many is there?
how many?
those are doing something, aren't they, Child?
no, no, no.
be careful because we don't want to lose them.
these are very special to us.
turns out Investigator had more toys that he wasn't letting on.
was he holding out on us?
well, if those aren't toys I don't know what is.
I guess.
okay.
no, I don't .
no, I don't .
like this.
it's the same shape, right?
is it the same size?
what are you checking?
what are you try?
uhhuh.
is it?
oh.
do they have the same numbers on them?
no?
is this the same as this?
how are they different?
how come it's different?
oh, Child, I think this is very exciting.
you know what we can use these as?
we should, they are.
what am I pretending they are?
building a tower with them.
what do you build a tower with?
what did I pretend that was?
should I put this one here?
will it balance?
no.
no.
or we could do it this way.
what am I doing?
do you want to try that?
now what are you doing?
oh.
what are you doing, Child?
are you playing with blocks?
beads!
where's the other one?
we're missing one.
do you have one in your hand?
no, it's still there.
okay.
I think it's very hard to do, isn't it, honey?
another one of what?
of the brown ones?
no.
but you know what you can put?
you know what you could do?
you could put that one there.
what are you going to do there?
now why didn't that work?
it was so what?
so big?
which one was so big?
mhm.
so big you couldn't put it on top?
you were too big?
are you big now?
I think so.
are you dirty?
you are a little dirty.
shall we, let me just skritch it off.
probably a little bit of paste.
were you pasting something in school today?
or it could be a little yogurt.
did you have yogurt for lunch?
looks like paste.
there.
Child, now what are you doing?
now what are you doing?
is that silly talk?
you know who else Investigator goes to play with?
if you don't play with me Investigator will play with you?
uhhuh.
do you know who else Investigator goes and plays with?
who?
what's not there?
what's not there?
is something missing?
did something go away?
what?
what?
do you think it's the thing that's missing?
you don't remember what.
how many just fell?
there.
were they in your hand?
is that why you did that?
no, we found it.
yes, we were trying to find them.
why?
because they're Investigator's toy and he does't want to lose them.
do you like to lose your toys?
can you speak up?
she goes to.
tell me loud so I can hear.
yeah.
where does the water come from?
from the faucet that she turned on?
and she forgot to turn it off?
now what's this story?
here comes a chicken.
and the chicken sees a great big egg.
and the chicken sits on the egg.
then what happens?
right.
did we see a chicken today?
where?
where?
you don't know?
was it at the museum, remember?
did we see some little tiny chickens trying to come out of some
remember that, honey?
you didn't ?
oh, I showed them to you.
what else did we see at the museum?
we saw, we read this whole book now I think.
oh, no, we still have this piece, this one.
going to do that?
what happens?
she gets out and that mashes the pie in his face.
that's the end of that book.
I'll bet Investigator brought his toys.
shall we
what were you doing when you did it?
Child, tell Investigator, did we go to the museum today?
what did we see at the museum?
what did we see?
did we see anything?
a dinosaur?
what did we do anything with the dinosaur?
what?
did we make him roar?
how did we make him roar?
you don't know what made him roar?
did it involve a nickel?
what did we do?
make him roar like a nickel!
let's look at Investigator's toys.
now what are those, Child?
why are you whispering?
what would you like to play with?
shall we play with your dollhouse and your farm?
shall we do that?
or let's see, what else can we play with?
what do you want?
what we can do with them.
then what?
why don't you tell us?

is that roof going to go on?
now what does that mean, Child?
there, you did it!
you
yeah, Investigator doesn't know how to play with those toys.
we could do all kinds of things with the baby.
now which one is the mommy and which one is the daddy and which one
does the baby push the mommy in the stroller?
what happens to the baby now?
why shouldn't I?
not?
look what's over there.
look what's here.

so we can look at it.
where did you get a real lion?
that's the lion right there.

one more page of pictures and that's all.
oh!
Child!
this will interest Investigator!
do you know who this person is?

just a lot?
can you count all those beads?
you need to unbuckle it?
well, that's not the one you unbuckle.
do you want me to unbuckle it for you?
you unbuckle the top one.
you leave that one buckled.
because you can still put it on.
but that's the wrong foot.
let's see if you can take it out.
no, the other way.
pull it the other way.
nah.
that way will never come out.
yes, that one.
okay, you started it and I'll finish it.

that's right.
shall I press it?
I'm turning.
no, these guys are nice.
these are Dorothy's friends.
it's hard to be patient, isn't it?

we skipped a ring though, Child, this is the page we're on.
the birds part is where we're at right now.

Dorothy threw water on her and it made her melt.
I don't know.
Toto.

why don't you put the tapes and the books away and we'll do
you want to see what Observer has in the bag?

there's toys in here.
look inside, see if there's anything.
want to take a look?

oh, that's a nice one.
and here's some animals.
you can look inside the other one.

want me to help you?
oh, that's not easy to do.
oops, that's happened before, don't worry about it.

it fell off.
all the way.
there.
who do we know that has a station wagon?
who do we know that has a station wagon car?
yeah, I'm trying to fix it so it doesn't fall off, hold on a second.
do you know what kind of a truck that is?
oops, it's a lost cause.
it's hard to fix.
sure.
it turns around like that.
that's a cement mixer, Child.
does he have one like that?
it is?
I didn't know he had one.
he does, he has a station wagon too?
now it willn't close.
I don't know.
it's a broken car.
the bottom part?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
nope.
I don't know, why don't you check the bag and see?
books?
what books, are they books that we have or are they different?
go ahead, look.
it's a word book, Child.
what are those?
animals?
a giraffe.
he has a Do_You_Know book that has a giraffe in it, that's right.
that's sort of like his Do_You_Know book.
a book with lots of pictures and things, isn't it?
that's right.
yeah, you want to get them out, show the horses to each other?
that horse could be the little baby horse.
that's even smaller, that that one, isn't it?
very little.
now we have three horses.
and they what?
they melted?
oh.
did someone throw water on them?
remember, we took them in the bathtub and they didn't melt, did

it did?
oh, too bad.

your chin is going to melt, witch.
I want to see some pictures in this book and see if there are any

there's a cake in this Do_You_Know book?
a dinosaur, oh, we know somebody who likes dinosaurs, don't we?
those are all the colors.
do you know your colors?
you know lots of colors.
very good.
this is about clothes that you wear.
I don't see any diapers, this must be a big girl book.
do you wear diapers?
that's right, you do.
but soon you'll wear underpants.
look, there's underpants right there, pink ones.
Andreas wears white ones?
yeah, he does.
what is that thing?

hmm?
no, no, that's something else.
udder.
that's where milk comes out, right, for the baby cows and for us too
stop drinking the cow.
people don't drink out of that part, baby cows do.
how do you drink your milk?
is that a baby cow?
it is?
I don't think so.
that's a baby cow.
he can drink out of this cow.
whoops.
like that.
there.
well, he was too tall otherwise.
do you think mother cows give their, do you
I don't know, you can try.
that's a very heavy block.
he willn't rip those.
try it this way, try it on the wide side.
that's a little better, isn't it?
there, he did it.
he did it.
very good.
okay, find some more animals.
what other animals do you see?
um hmm, little puppies.

no, I said up high in the corner there's a little
an ant, it looks like an ant, it's a spider, mhm.
yeah, houses.
which is the kind of house we live in?
that's right, that's where.
you know your address, don't you?
you willn't get lost.
do you remember the number?
blow.
blow.
good job.
good job, good job.
oh, I know, that's kind of a broken thing.
oh, here's a page with all sorts of birds.
now why did they put the spider on the animal page instead of on the
that's a good question.
can you fix it?
I don't think I can, Child.
I think it's a goner.
it has to go to the car hospital.
do you think we should send this car to George's garage?
or the junk yard.
a toy car, George doesn't fix toy cars?
he gives toy cars though, remember one day we went there and he gave
I remember.
do you want, you want Joyce to give you that, do you mean Observer?
or are you talking about Joyce?
oh, George to give you that.
George gave you a toy car.
can't fix it, Observer will have to take
good morning, this is Child Lastname and Parent Lastname and we are
it is Saturday, February twenty two.
and both Observer and Investigator are taping.
is that enough for right now or do you want more?
here we go.
what does it look like?
can you build a farm with it?
oh, new toys, huh, Child.
you used to have one of those when you were a baby.
do you remember?
a hedgehog?
you used to chew on it.
oh, okay.
what did, what did Observer bring with her today?
what things?
what does that look like?
a what?
a what?
a Waffelo?
is that what you called it?
can I braid your hair while you play with it?
since we didn't get around to braiding today?
she had braids in her hair last time.
she had lots of braids last time.
this guy squeaks too.
whoops.
what's the other one?
a wappeloc, huh?
when Andreas was a little, little baby, we brought him to the store.
not one of those, no.
just the other two.
and when you came out, and you were a baby, and you played
until they just got too old and too dirty from too many children
threw them away.
we threw them away, that's right.
okay, ready?
here comes the rubber band.
oh, boy.
looks like you have a very unhappy brother, Child.
Sister.
oh, oops.
sorry.
bet we can get those horses over there and that horse and we can.
remember the last time we had baby horses and everything?
yes, she does.
I'm going to do this side now, okay?
oops.
why do you like all the horses to lie down?
standing farm.
she likes them lying down.
sleeping animals.
okay, we'll do the other braid now.
mushy.
pop goes the weasel.
oops.
you know, I babysat a kid and uh, he had one of these too, he
oh, really.
the trouble is if you take those in the bathtub they get filled up.
do they still squeak when there water in them?
well, a little bit.
Andreas always wanted to take his in the bathtub, because Ernie on
oh, yeah.
but I don't know, I bet Ernie's doesn't get very wet.
I bet Ernie's doesn't squeak either.
okay, here's the rubber band again.
ready?
hmm?
you're being silly.
whoops, hold still, we're almost done.
there we go.
hmm?
he's what?
oops.
gee, busy family.
I like the bows on your sleeve there.
pretty.
nope.
well, you've got the ribbons but not the bows.
she's a bad what?
bid?
is that a he or a she?
that's one of the workmen.
yes.
pop goes the person?
what water?
I bet they do float in the water.
because they're wood.
uhhuh.
do you have one of these guys over in there?
what is that?
mm huh.
I bet you a cow's over there too.
and I think I see.
I see some of these over there too.
you're right, he's a bull.
here's a cow.
just wanted attention by Mom, huh?
yup, she did not want to take a nap, when she knew there was
oh, you want to show her that one?
what is it?
a police?
it's Dick the policeman?
oh, okay this is Dick the policeman.
Child went to work with me last week one day.
really.
I work at a junior college and there was a policeman there named
and I think she, she sort of liked him and she's been talking about
who's this?
oh, they're all Dick.
let's see what kind of people you have here.
I'll pull those over here.
here's some more animals.
what's this?
everybody is Dick.
that's not?
who's that?
a bad guy?
that looks like a woman.
to me.
bad guy.
really?
what're the bad guys doing?
in jail?
where's the jail?
uhhuh.
really?
what did they do that made them bad?
what did he do?
why are they bad?
did you watch the movie yesterday with Andreas about Horton?
Horton the elephant, Child?
did you watch?
I know he didn't want it on but did you watch it while it was on?
no?
you did what?
you sat in your booster chair?
you don't know.
there's one over there.
hidden.
uhhuh.
do you like our horses?
the little horse knocked all those big horses down?
why?
jaguar?
that's a jaguar?
that guy's pretty ugly.
that one is.
who's not going to jail?
Child, what's a jail?
what, what's a jail?
hmm?
plop?
what's plop mean?
does it mean plop over?
is that why they're all plopped over?
are you talking nonsense?
is this nonsense talk?
hmm?
plopped in?
no, that's Observer's .
I'm just letting you play with it.
we might have some of those down in the baby toys still, you know.
in, in the baby toy box, in the garage.
maybe we still have those squeaky toys.
maybe I didn't throw them away, maybe I just put them away.
we can go downstairs and look.
not right this minute.
too hard to find things, down in the garage.
after we'll go downstairs and then look in the garage for all of
those two?
well, we have this one.
you know what?
Andreas called this Stonzo.
yeah?
we have squeaky toys.
that's ours though.
that's Andreas's .
see, this is Observer's here.
it's different.
his head is loose and this one doesn't have a loose head
yes, that's right.
the blue elephant does.
yeah, he has a loose nose too.
yup.
well, it's kind of nice that he moves around.
Alexandra wants to hold on to one elephant.
did you ask Observer what happened to her broken station wagon?
Child remembered that you had a broken station wagon.
oh, yeah?
still have it, I think.
left it in there.
you have a broken car today.
never made it to the car shop.
there it is.
try to keep it on.
I was listening to some of the tapes and every single one where that
but it's fun to have something that opens.
he did?
ah.
the people should be safe.
they shouldn't get run over by cars.
I thought the people were in jail.
they've got ta go to the hospital now.
we're very careful though, right?
that we don't get run over by cars?
that's why we hold hands.
you don't ?
you don't hold hands?
of course you do.
I always make you hold my hand.
when we're near cars.
no, of course not.
we're very careful when we're in the car.
right?
we wear seatbelts so we'll be safe.
that's right and you climb out.
those poor people.
maybe we could make a family with those people.
a farm family, since there's so many farm animals.
there's not?
there's no farm animals?
there's a horse, cow, turkey, chicken.
we could make a farm, you know, if you'd like.
we have blocks over there.
would you like to get some blocks and make a farm?
what's a car farm?
we could go in the back and get our farm fence and our silo.
okay, we can bring it.
why?
what kind of a truck, hmm?
is that one Andreas's ?
where did he get it from?
oh, I know, from Bermuda, right?
that's right.
we brought this back from Bermuda for him.
hmm?
that's right.
what did you get from Bermuda?
and a hair dryer?
um hmm.
a station wagon.
a car.
that kind of car is called a station wagon.
like Barbara's car, that you ride to school in sometimes.
okay, that you ride home from school in.
you're silly.
oops.
does this open?
nope, it doesn't open but you know what?
the only thing this thing does is you can buy a trailer.
and put it, put the rope in this hole and you can pull.
you can pull a trailer.
because this is a tractortrailer truck.
but we only have one part.
I know but see but this thing can pull something else.
Lala does?
I don't think Observer knows who Lala is.
who's Lala?
you go to school with her?
Observer asked you if you go to school with her.
do you go to school with Lala?
sometimes she's sick?
are you ever sick?
Lala's Child's pretend friend.
oh.
right?
where does Lala live these days?
you don't know?
doesn't she live in the cupboard anymore?
she did?
where did she move to?
you don't know?
but you just put her prediction in, in her old house the other
only yesterday.
didn't you
so you just put it in the old one?
is it still in there?
is it?
go check and see.
what about Plum_Plum, does she live there anymore?
Child had two.
um hmm.
it's not there.
I think it's on the kitchen table.
two friends who lived in our cupboard.
yeah.
I took it out, because when I put the pots and pans in I didn't have
well, you could if you want.
if Lala doesn't live there anymore she doesn't need the prediction.
does she?
she does?
oops!
look what just flew into my hand!
uh oh.
what about Plum_plum?
Lalalilk lives there?
three friends.
alright, I'll try.
you think Dad will answer the phone?
that's good.
there you go.
you're welcome, station wagon.
hmm?
oh.
this car causes so much trouble.
whoops, sorry.
careful.
careful, you flew off backwards and you'll have a hurt head.
oh.
I can't do it.
maybe Observer can do it.
let me try it.
bring it over here?
oops.
you know what, your sister lost her elephant.
it's under your mom's foot.
you want to pick it up for her?
here.
she's trying to crawl after it.
Observer's having trouble too, huh?
you flopped in the water?
where's the water?
would you like to take swimming lessons?
is that what, is that why you're talking about flopping in the
fixed it.
she fixed it.
a very big hop.
don't chew the car, Child.
it's not good for your teeth.
that's a people road, huh?
can we stand those back up again?
how come you want everybody to lie down?
hmm?
I like the cement truck.
the cement mixer.
um hmm.
bright colors.
pretty colors.
I don't know.
does it open?
it turns though, right?
I don't know.
does it?
just a little bit, though.
do we have any cars that have doors that open?
you think that car does?
uh hmm.
a rabbit does.
uh hmm.
where is it?
you want to get it?
no, I didn't do that.
I only put things in the basement that we don't use very much.
like baby toys, uh hmm.
you have to be gentle with Andra.
she'll want it if you offer it to her.
don't , maybe you shouldn't put it on her, so she doesn't try to have
she can't ?
you gave him to her.
I don't remember that.
over Dick.
poor Dick the policeman.
you think he likes to be run over with the car?
in the road?
you know, if you put those people, people up on the table they would
I think you hurt someone's feelings.
okay.
I think you better say sorry, Alexandra.
did she hurt your feelings by saying no to you, is that
let her have Dick.
let her have Dick.
it keeps her happy, okay?
you know, she's just a baby.
oh, really.
is that why she didn't cry?
I think she didn't cry because she has Dick in her hand.
see, if you take Dick away and you say no then she gets mad, and
let's not try it.
you have all those people to play with.
so she can have Dick.
well, let's trade, let's give her one of those instead.
why don't you pick one out?
you're thinking?
which one are you thinking about giving her?
which one?
that, that little little one?
the very littlest one?
oh, this one instead, huh?
there, see, she's interested as long as she has one to hold on to.
yeah, don't put it in your mouth.
because Observer has to go and take those to other children.
other two, other two year old children.
like the children in your class.
you know, like Emily, Suzanne, Jessie, Jason, Christopher.
right?
right, Observer?
Christopher's not in your class?
you know what?
if we move this table you could stand the people up on the table.
would you like to stand them up?
no, I don't want you to run the car on the table.
no.
not unless you give her another one to play with.
you think she'll like such a small one?
well, let's see.
why don't you offer it to her?
you mean you want to keep trading?
sometime she might say no.
she just got it.
she wants to look at it.
she's looking at it to see what it is.
no, don't , don't .
well, squeaking it at her's okay, but knocking her on the head with
she doesn't like that.
do you like it?
let me see if I like it.
no, I don't like it much.
too loud.
oh, it's much too loud and it pulls my hair.
stand up the mother.
she can't ?
try.
you're going to fall off.
there's a little girl with a cat.
who's that?
Dick?
who's this?
what does this look like?
a man who goes to church?
really?
because he's Greek?
hmm.
yeah.
he looks like a Greek man, huh?
why does he look Greek?
maybe because he's big what?
oh, a brown coat.
what's this around his neck?
a scarf?
a necktie.
it's a necktie.
so he looks like a Greek man that goes to church, huh?
what's he carrying in his hand?
I think it's a briefcase.
it's not?
what is it?
oh here, look, you can see it from this side too.
what do you think?
oh, okay.
so he's a Greek man.
why don't you go stand him up on the table?
what about this person?
he is?
what kind of a Greek man?
a Greek man doing what?
a church Greek man.
you sat on something  to squeak
here comes trouble.
yeah.
okay.
let her have one, okay?
it keeps her happy.
you have so many.
so many people.
what's the orange guy?
with the ball in his hand?
this one here in the front.
the orange one.
with the numbers on his chest.
on his shirt.
this one right there.
what numbers are they?
maybe oh or eight?
maybe.
you are?
you're going to give some?
no.
uhhuh.
oh, you have so many.
that's good.
that's good.
I'm glad you're taking them out of jail.
whoops!
they're all standing?
how about if I give your sister one of the animals?
you think she'll like that?
they all stand up.
which one's Dick?
which one is Dick?
that one.
because he has on a hat?
is that why he's Dick?
air comes out, huh?
oops.
do the animals stand up too?
look who's tired here.
look at this.
somebody's tired.
let her have one.
okay?
thanks.
what happens when you knock the table?
looks like they dance, doesn't it?
they didn't just fall over, I think somebody pushed them over.
it wasn't ?
are the ladies, are the women Dick?
ah.
look what happened.
oh, dear.
okay.
I think you moved the table by accident, huh?
did you want them to all fall over?
uh hmm.
he did.
it's hard, it's hard to do it that way, Child.
it's hard to put the ones in the front up first.
oops.
see?
did you get them all?
oh.
whoops!
the domino effect.
uh hmm.
keep knocking over, huh.
that looks like a grandfather.
I see, you've got them all standing up.
oops.
okay.
so they're all going to sleep?
are they sleeping on their tummies?
look, they're all sleeping right on their faces.
on their tummies?
oh, hurted her bum?
Child, careful.
don't want cars falling on people who are sleeping!
no?
yeah?
on bunk beds?
like you have a bunk bed?
no, you don't go on the top.
that's right.
that's right.
because Andreas is bigger.
and what about Alexandra?
do you sleep in a crib?
not this morning.
so they're all sleeping on their tummies?
I see one guy's face.
the Greek guy.
going to church.
what are you doing?
you humming?
now I see Dick's face.
uh hmm.
oh, the cement mixer?
it's not that?
I thought that was what you wanted.
you know what, Child, I've got another one of those.
you can have one and give one to Alexandra, too.
wow.
look.
let Alexandra have one.
you can share, right?
why does Observer have two?
I don't know.
why don't you ask her?
no, what?
no, what?
no, don't eat it.
which is it?
yeah, but
but they're the same.
they're cement mixers.
you want two?
then you better offer her a different truck, I think.
you'll have to get a different oops!
she's very expressive.
um!
you ought to look at one year old communication.
that's fine.
a very few.
whatever works works.
you did?
I think she has too many things now.
would you like the elephant?
two elephants and two cement trucks?
is everybody asleep again?
what's Dick doing?
I don't see anybody's face.
everybody's sleeping on their tummy.
who?
her who?
oh yeah, the grandmother.
I see her face.
I see grandmother's face.
nope.
because you turned her.
I don't know, do I?
Alexandra, do you want two elephants?
want that?
I didn't take it away.
it just fell.
there's too many, too many toys.
why?
shall we go and get a haircut this week?
look how long your bangs are.
they're down and they're in your eyes.
maybe we should go to the hairdresser.
hairdresser.
beauty shop.
would you like to go to the beauty shop and get your hair cut?
would you sit still?
while somebody cuts your hair?
Karen cuts Andreas's hair.
would you like to go see somebody like Karen?
and wear a bib?
and get a lollipop afterwards?
did you drop it last time?
is that what happened?
you dropped it and it got dirty?
well, maybe you willn't drop it next time.
take the plastic off to eat it though, okay?
no.
so let's make an appointment and go get your hair cut.
too many things for such a small girl.
yeah, that's better.
just some at a time is better.
make up your mind.
your mind.
I think she wanted both of them.
uhhuh.
I see.
I don't know.
ask Observer about that.
why do I have two of what?
I can't see.
oh, two of the cement trucks?
well, I think because sometimes, you know, when we go to a house
with Alexandra we have three children.
oops.
sorry.
three children at our house.
six people in our house, huh?
that's a lot.
that's a lot of people.
I don't know.
is his head all smashed in?
who did that to poor old ducky?
can I help you fix her?
there.
you fixed it yourself, huh?
yeah.
oh, Alexandra, did you just wet your diaper and go on my leg?
will you stay here and play while I go change Alexandra?
I'll come right back.
hmm?
well, how about if I leave Alexandra here and I'll just bring her
okay?
okay.
just be careful what she takes.
yeah, don't throw the toys.
yeah, don't give her so much.
I'm giving her all of them.
oop, she doesn't want those.
she wants something different.
look at this.
what's this?
oop, should we lie it down too?
and is this a sheep too?
what's that?
looks like she wants the sheep.
you know what this is?
a duck.
it's called a mallard duck.
Make_way_for_ducklings?
Mr and Mrs Mallard.
right and their family?
her mat?
because I didn't want to change her on the couch.
here.
here comes a gorilla.
an ugly gorilla.
got a dry diaper.
yes, the dry diaper that you picked, that's right.
whoops, she dropped something.
can you get something for her hand?
there's no poop.
would you go throw this in the trash for me?
help me out?
no?
gee, thanks.
you're usually such a big helper.
no, you're not a helper now?
that's too bad, I thought you were.
this is the one you picked.
I know, I took it out of the somebody's house bag.
oh, come on.
we'll put another one in that diaper bag.
it's no big deal.
okay.
hmm?
okay.
okay, pick another diaper.
I think her attention span is, ah, exhausted.
how are we going to do that?
well.
hmm?
you don't know?
well, I don't see any green sticks there, do you?
ummhm.
ok.
hmm.
that's right.
that's right.
very good.
now where does it go?
ummhm.
ummhm.
boy, it looks pretty complicated, Child.
want to put those on the bottom there?
hmm?
I don't know, let's see.
I put this one here.
I can't figure out how they work.
I'm just trying to figure it out!
what are you doing?
you're trying to blow that, make a sound out of it?
um.
now let me see.
there we go.
well, that's the start of one.
wait, where's the man going to go?
let's put the man on.
Honey, take this out of your mouth.
sounds like a helicopter.
hmm?
it's up in the sky.
it's looking, it must be, maybe it's looking for something.
ok.
you want to put the man on?
no?
oh, you mean you're going to make, make me do the whole thing?
you'll help me?
well, then you can get some red sticks.
you want to get some red sticks out?
ok.
let's put them right here.
those?
you're right, Child, we do look at that.
very good!
now let's finish?
very good, what comes next?
uh hmm, we do.
uh hmm.
uh hmm.
well, here's one of these.
let's see, this is sort of an improvised one, hmm?
we sort of improvised here, didn't we?
what about this?
yes, that looks like a forklift, doesn't it?
well
alright.
you mean you'll make me have to do it like it really is supposed to
let's see, we're going to have to
put this here, this here.
whoops, excuse me.
these drive me crazy.
someone gave these to him.
about four or five, no, four or five months ago, I think.
he doesn't play, he really got into it for a while and then
yeah.
and also he got them out again the other day, now we're back into
but they don't , they, you know, the wheels keep coming off, and
yeah.
do you want to get your horn out and play your horn?
hmm?
the one that you got for Christmas?
and sing a little song?
no.
no.
now that looks more like it.
yes, it is.
yes
Child, what do you think is in here?
why don't we look in there?
want to look inside and grab something?
there might be something interesting in there.
oh.
wow, look at that, a book.
wow.
oh.
oh, what is that?
is that a sheep?
or a poodle dog?
looks like a fancy poodle dog, hmm?
Child, do you think anything opens up there?
no, it doesn't look like it does.
oh, well, maybe.
look, opens up.
uhhuh.
well, let's look and see.
that looks like a cement mixer.
let's look and see what else is in there.
oh, what are those?
um hmm.
what is that?
looks like a cow that's lying down.
hmm?
what else is in there?
hmm.
yes.
what's that?
a pony!
oh, another one.
you know what we could do?
we could make a garage for the trucks and a barn for the animals.
look at that.
how many, um, how many, um, cement mixers do we have here?
oh, what's that?
I don't know, what are these called?
porcupines?
oh.
hedgehog.
it's a hedgehog!
it's a squishy hedgehog.
and what's this one over here?
which?
ummhm!
anything else in there?

do you have all of them?
what is that?
well, what do you think?
no.
um hmm.
these go around.
that's right!
uh hmm.
it's a, I think it's a word book.
well, it's a, it's , I think it's called a word book.
there's no story but there are all sorts of words that go together
what is it?
yeah.
all of them?
you want to do that?
go get your blocks out?
um hmm.
um hmm.
it's a funny hedgehog.
ok.
want to get the blocks out?
I don't know, we were looking for that yesterday, and I couldn't
if you get all those out maybe we can find it.
well.
can you give me some blocks so we can set it up?
hmm?
I see, you built a ramp on yourself.
mmm.
these animals.
should we build a ramp?
uhhuh?
yes?
what will I need?

I don't know, I think we lost the wheel.
well, it came out one day and I don't know what happened to it.
we'll have to do it without a wheel.
he turned the motor off?
did you put him there?
oh, good.
oh, good.
do you want to put the animals in their stalls first?
no, ok.
what are we doing?
wow.
oh, ok.
way up in the air?
that's pretty clever.
how's he going to do that?
they pull the strings?
and that makes the tractor go up in the air?
hmm.
that's very clever.
that's very clever.
now.
you going home?
ok.
where is his stall?
well, how about over here in these stalls here?
what, what do you want?
well, what's wrong with it where it is?
we could just take some, just take some blocks out?
hmm?

I don't know whether Sara wants to hear us singing or not.
what do you think?

um hmm.
what did Mummy do?
oh, I see.
what is that?
do you remember what we called it?

what's this?
and a farm?
a barn and a farm?
a barn and a farm?
well, let's get this house out of the way now, shall we?
and can you get the blocks out?
you can't ?
why not?

let's get some blocks out.
ok.
what did they do to bump their nose?
they're going to be careful?
good, I'm glad.
is it all set for him?
well, what do we have to do to make it set for him?
yes.
I think it's a poodle dog.
um hmm.
that looks like a collie dog.
it's a different kind of dog.
should we get some blocks out?
oh, lion.
oh, Big Bird too.
I get Big Bird?
very nice.
are we going to build a, uh, are we going to build a barn, Child, for the
we are.
can you get some more blocks out so we can build?
I think she can see.
I think she can see.
we're going to have a parade?
let's do this first.
oh, thank you.
he's going to grab it in his paw?
now what do I do with it?
right there?
ok.
you want to give me another block?
oh, ok, where're we going to put that?
well, maybe we ought to put this this way.
then they can walk up the ramp and walk along there.
right there.
like this.
ah, ok.
cl.
farmer!
farmer!
farmer!
yes, Child?
why not?
well, would you hurry up and finish so I can put my animals in the
I've got a poodle dog and a collie dog and a pony and a cow that's
a sheep?
that's a dog.
well, it's white.
it looks like a sheep but I think it's called a puddle, a
we can pretend it's a sheep if you want.
ok.
where shall we put those?
you tell me.
how about, let's see.
we were going to make some stalls here.
to put the animals in.
make a door?
how are we going to make a door?
there.
this could be the door.
swing it open, swing it closed.
should we do it that way?
you swing it open when you want to put an animal in there?
who should we put in there?
hmm?
you want to put the elephant in?
do you want to get some of your own animals out?
no.
ok.
oh.
you want to close the door?
there.
now he's all nice in his little stall for the night.
should we give him some hay?
except, except you know that's a dog and I don't know that dogs eat
I bet they eat dog food.
we don't know about that because we don't have a dog but I think
does he love hay?
there.
now.
oh, a garage.
well, you want to make a stall for him?
and a door?
I don't know that dogs eat, eat a lot of hay.
I think horses like hay and cows like hay.
and sheep, well, sheep eat grass.
I don't know if they like hay.
dogs, dogs like dog bones.
they like to chew on bones and eat dog food.
hi, Child.
and who else?
what about me?
am I here playing with you?
yes.
your train?
want to get your train out?
well, we're not going to play soccer ball right now.
not in the house, Child.
not in the house, ok?
we can go outside later and play that.
maybe if Investigator's still here.
now you want to finish the, the barn or you want to get your train
alright, let's put some of these things away so we have room for
empty.
it's the what to the train?
oh.
should we get your train out?
I'm not sure I feel like playing tinker toys this morning.
hmm?
you do?
are you sure?
well, what are we going to do with these animals here?
we're going to give them a rest?
they're going to watch?
alright.
you want to leave them all right here?
what about the farmer?
what's going to happen to him?
ok.
with big lion?
ok.
now.
what shall we make?
Helen made this?
look at that.
it up.
that's right.
lookit.
um hmm.
you want to make that one?
you can't make that one then, huh?
no.
they have different sets and we don't have the orange ones, do we?
but what do we do sometimes?
do we improvise, is that what we do?
you want to try to make that?
well, what do we need?
yes, we do.
you want to get those out?
a sword?
you're going to fly it?
hmm.
where's it going?
well, what do we need?
let's see here, what do we need?
you want to get the yellow sticks and the green sticks out?
ok, now where we going to put those?
well, that's the start of that wrecker that we're going to make.
you want to put the yellow ones right in there?
it's hard, it's hard to understand.
there, very good, Child.
there.
pretty fancy.
well, I put that there.
sort of.
we're sort of improvising here.
how does this go?
I'm trying to make that.
I need a little yellow, uh, orange one like this, Child.
yeah, you've got it.
can you give it to me?
just like that one of the little ones.
are you using that?
ok.
now what do I do?
oh.
um hmm.
oh, Child, this is awfully frustrating for mommy, these things.
cause they keep falling off and
see, everything keeps falling off, Child.
um.
let's do something else, shall we?
can we do something else?
how about some other toys?
I'd like to make a barnyard for your animals, that's what I'd like
make a big barn for the animals, and a farmyard.
hmm?
these look awfully complicated.
well, which one do you want to make?
a locomotive.
why don't we get our own locomotive out and fill that up?
I haven't seen that in a while, the one that Uncle Rick gave you for
the one Uncle Rick gave you for Christmas, it's over there, in the
let's get that out and put some things in it, ok?
let's put these away.
for now.
on my back?
I don't think they fit on my back.
careful, don't spill them, whoa, there they go.
now, what about the locomotive, what about the train?
you got ta clean up first.
what's going on over there?
you stepped on my toes.
oops.
let's get this, uh, train out Child.
you have another idea?
what's your other idea?
I put the fire chief's hat on?
to be the fire chief?
well, that means I can order you around if I'm the chief.
I can tell you what to do.
you want to have a parade?
what am I going to do?
oh, the yellow thing?
you have put it away.
in the tinker toy box.
because we wouldn't want to lose it, would we?
hmm?
you going to blow the horn?

firechief, firechief, calling fireman Bob or fireman Jim?
or fireman Child.

what are those?
what are you going to do, Child, Child?

hmm?
it goes around and around on a truck.
he means
this?
this?
your dump truck.
let's see, do we have a dump truck?
one of these?
no?
oh, um.
you mean the one that's usually in the garage?
I don't think we have a dump truck that we play with in here, do we?
I don't think we have a dump truck in here.
I think it's in the garage.
didn't we have it out yesterday afternoon, you mean that one, that
well, we're going to stay in here for just a little bit.
um.
let's see what's in here.
hey, there's something in here.
look at that.
oh, I had forgotten all about that.
now put that into that.
there, like that?
there, you're learning how to do that on your own.
very good, Child.
there's the dump truck.
now you're going to dump something into it?
bless you.
mmm.
it's a what car?
scraper car.
that's probably a good zoomer, Child.
you want to zoom that around on the floor?
right around that floor there, over where Investigator is?
zoom it over to Investigator.
oh.
there.
backwards?
see what happens.
oh.
whoop.
ok, keep it on the floor, keep it on the floor now.
oh, that's a big zoom.
what a racket.
the squeaky ball?
ok.
ok.
what do you want to do?
we were going to get our train out.
do you want to do that?
we're either going to get the train out, or we're going to build a barn.
which one do you want to do?
hmm?
which one?
you want to talk to the animals?
build a barn for the animals?
oh, you want to sing?
oh, well, I'll tell you what.
we're going to play for just a little bit longer and then we can sing.
ok.
let's play for just a little bit longer and then we'll sing.
how about if you take the animals on a train ride?
we could do that.
you want to put the animals on, and take them for a train ride?
hmm?
no.
we've played enough.
well, do you want to, uh, we'll do one Christmas carol, ok?
and you have to sing it with me right now.
and we're just going to do one.
ok?
you look for the one that you want to do.
what are you looking for?
which one are you looking for?
I knew that's the one you were looking for.
yeah.
this one?
now you want to, why don't we read it, ok?
or do you want to sing it?
will you sing it with me?
ok?
good for you.
finished?
ok?
well, we were going to build a, uh, barnyard.
for the animals.
and then when we're through, you are going to go outside and do some
it's such a nice day outside.
well, who do you think?
who'd you like to be running around with?
oh, you would, would you?
how about Daddy?
oh, ok.
me and Investigator.
well, we'll see.
I think Investigator's going to have to leave in a little bit.
and go somewhere else.
but if she's still here she can run around with us.
we're going to mow the animal's grass?
from where?
where?
now look at this.
look at this.
a barn for the animals.
