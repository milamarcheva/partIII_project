one of the interesting things about this with children of this age is that the mutual exclusiveness of the answers is not understood.
so that the the chance base is not fifty fifty.
I was wondering about that.
they quite freely will point to the same one for for both or to both at once or anything like that.
so you don't get that concept of of mutual exclusivity.

cut a froggie.
cover your mouth.
I must be coming down with a cold.
Sarah, what did you do to your cheek?
does it itch?
is that the beginning of a froggie?
oh it looks like his house.
there.
we went to a wake last night.
and after the wake we went over to the Prudential.
my two cousins and I we decided you know to go over the Prudential for a cup of coffee.
well we went in. Shirley had a dollar. Eleanor had two and I had three.
the bill was five twenty.
what did you do?
then I had some change.
we had no intentions of going anywhere after the wake.
we come out. we walked, you know, all around and I figured it's so beautiful up there, the fountain.
I keep meaning to go up there.
oh it's swell.
we come out.
I had taken the Mass Turnpike in.
as you come up from the Mass Turnpike it said no parking.
so you know we parked and said.
let's get out of here.
so we were in about two hours.
we come out and we couldn't find the car.
did you figure it was stolen?
we couldn't find the parking lot.
we come out the wrong door.
we come out.
the back and the front look exactly alike.
uhhuh.
you know they've got the big escalators to go up and everything.
we couldn't find the parking lot.
we're standing there killing ourselves laughing.
for an hour we kept walking up and down up and down.
my poor cousin Shirley was so sick.
she had an awful cold.
we dragged her all over the place.
her feet were killing her.
finally we come against a guard up front you know.
he said.
I wondered what you three were laughing about.
we lost the car you know.
finally he said.
I don't know where you could've put it.
there's a little parking lot way down behind there. you go down. then you go up and down.
he said.
the cars always get towed away and it'll cost you eight dollars.
we didn't even have ten cents to make a phone call.
we were hysterical.
finally we found the car.
it was still there.
it was the same parking lot?
yeah.
the towing away one?
yeah they didn't tow ours anyway.
Sarah, when are you goING To learn how to drive?
yeah.
down at the Stop_and_Shop parking lot he had her sitting in his lap and she was steering the car.
are you good good at steering?
mmhm.
everytime I think about last I start laughing.
what?
every time I think of last night can kill myself laughing.
three idiots walking up and down the sidewalk.
oh.
you feel so silly and helpless.
we didn't know whether to go right or to go left.
nothing looked familiar.
we didn't know where to go.
we went to the ladies room and we had a dime.
I had a dime and I gave it to Eleanor.
she put the dime in the thing that you turn?
then instead of pushing it in she pushed it out and the dime went down you know.
just then the matron come in.
and Eleanor said.
well I put the dime in and the. you know I just can't get in.
the matron said.
you you didn't put a dime in.
oh.
oh it was awful.
we had a heck of a time.
anyway that girl was upset.
she went out and got in the next one and on the way out the woman said.
well here's the dime.
Eleanor.
by this time Eleanor was tearing you know.
and Eleanor said.
I don't want the dime.
but I put the dime in.
she said.
well she was right.
that's terrible.
they lose more money that way than by giving out a few dimes to people who put things in just as a matter of principle.
yeah Eleanor says.
I don't care about the old stinking dime but it was the only one we had.
and she said we didn't put it in you know.
next time I go to a wake with them I'm goING To make sure I take money with me.
Shirley was?
Auntie_Shirley went with me last night.
Auntie_Eleanor came.
everytime we go over there we get into trouble or something happens.
last time we got in the elevator.
my husband and I went, and Eleanor and her husband.
we got up in the elevator and pushed the button.
we weren't supposed to be up there anyway up on the seventh floor to look at the pool.
we pushed the button.
I don't know we pushed the wrong button.
it was the emergency button and bells were going all over the place.
we took off and left him standing there.
then we got locked in one of the rooms upstairs near the pool.
oh dear.
everything happens.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
her and her bright ideas.
Sarah, try holding it here and here and then you can move it wider.
see.
put your finger like this.
see how I hold it?
you're doing this and then you can't hardly squeeze it.
put it more at the end of your fingers and then you can cut better.
yeah maybe your fingers aren't long enough.
that's better though. there is better than there.
see if you can cut better like that.
I guess you're right.
pretty good.
it seems so funny to hold scissors that way.
way down here.
cutting with a giant scissors gardening shears.
you want a cup of tea?

.
she
made a tl this morning
.
she
was all excited
.
she
did
n't
expect
it
to
come
out
I
guess
and
look like a tl
.
if
it's so easy
how come
you
make all the mistakes

's an upsidedown apple
.
the stem
's at the bottom
.

?
I don't know.
it
looks
like
a six or a nine
or
something
.
what
do
you
think it is
?
I don't know.
well
it
did
n't
look
like
a wl to me

at the bottom
.
an fl doesn't .
oh.

'll
be
telling
the teacher
how to write
.
long as
she
could
n't
tell
why
this isn't a zl
.
let's see.
uhhuh.
what
comes next
?
I
think
that
's an accident
.
two
out of three
.
I
don't know, Sarah
.
you
never
hit
two out of three
.
and
what
's the last letter
?
that
's the middle letter
.
cl al
what
for cat
?
it
's
the letter
you
just
learned
how
to
make, the next letter
.
what
do
you
think you are
?
you're the teacher?
you think so.
yeah
I
think
that
is a little better
.
if you say so.
you're the teacher.
you're the teacher.
no?
what
did you do
?
no
you
show me
.
a door
a peanut door
?
a peanut what?
a peanut lollipop?
who
's eating it
?
is
there
a little girl
eating it
?
she
made
a mess of herself
?
I guess so.
I
had
all the summer clothes
put
away
in the suitcase
.
you
have
to
get em all out again
?
now
I
got
ta
take
all the summer clothes
back
out of the suitcase
.
huh?
most of em
probably
will
n't
even
fit
you next year
either
.
you
know
what
that one is
.
the one
you
have in your hand
?
no the orange one.
yeah
you
know
what
that one is
.
it
still
looks like a wl
.
you tell me.
you know.
no it
's not an nl
.
it's a what?
no.
when
you
turn
it
up
the other way
what
's this
?
this is an nl.
that
only
has two hills
.
two legs.
and
what
's this one
?
that's an ml.
ml.
yeah
like
m_and_ms
you know
.
you m_and_ms?
yeah
you
know
m_and_ms alright
.
not very much.
find the al
and
put
the al
in between
and
that
'll spell a word
.
there you go.
you
know
what that is
?
man.
no the other way.
yes.
that
doesn't spell any word
.
now
put that first
.
put the jl first
.
and
then
put
the al
.
the other side, Sarah.
put
it
after it
on
the other side
of the jl
.
this way.
now
put
the ml
after the al
.
it
has
to
go
the other way around
.
right.
ml.
you
know
what that spells
?
no.
I
knew
that
was
all natural
when
she
said cl al
.
it spells jam.
jam.
nothing.
the wall?
still nothing.
no
you
make
up
your own language.
I
'm afraid
.
you
're
goING
To
never
make
a word
out of that
.
there
's
no word
at all
that
starts like that
.
you
mixed
something
up
in there
.
that
's
a number,
not a letter
.
can
you
tell
which one's a number
?
which one?
no that one.
you and your letters.
I don't know.
yes it does
but
it's not a word
.
that
's
what it spells
but
it
doesn't mean anything
.
you
can
n't
put it like that
.
turn it around.
no
turn the el around
.
that's right.
turn it around.
that
's going the wrong way
.
that
sounds
like when uh.
I
think
it
was
Courtney one day
had a list
.
she
would say something
and
Sarah
would
have
to
repeat it back
.
like.
some darn thing.
I

what it was
.
she
'd
look
at
her
you know

she moves her hand around.
that's what makes him fly.
well we'll give Melissa a project for the week to get a new one.
what's my name?
when she was little just after she started to talk instead of calling me Mama she'd call me Carol.

what's my problem?
well my problem is I should have stayed in bed this morning.
no.
so I can figure out these toe shoes.
so I can figure out these toe shoes.
I'm just trying to get the dirt off of them.
it'll probably get worse than that I suppose.
it'll probably get worse than that.
you don't know what to use on these, do you?
what about Carbona?
I haven't any of that.
this stuff is horrible.
spot remover spray?
mmhm.
fuller brush.
it didn't do a thing.
me.
I'm on a pony?
are those the words?
there that came off.
I had socks and stuff over it, you know?
but she couldn't dance in them.
mmhm.
the sock pulled.
all you got ta do is use it once ya know without the sock getting filthy.
Sarah, would you like to do some drawing?
no.
oh ohboy ohboy.
why don't you draw on the table.
draw on the table.
it's better because you got a cold.
you don't wanT To get more cold on the floor.
come on.
it's probably.
it'll probably end up ruining the toe shoes.
what?
yeah Esther will probably have a fit when she sees these.
yeah, honey.
lighter fluid would have stained.
what are you drawing, Sarah?
a million year?
a millionaire?
what's a millionaire?
he goes on a flyerkite?
why?
he flies with the air?
oh.
I think they look better dirty.
no it doesn't .
I better get the spray paint down the square.
your Mommy did?
what kind of birdie?
where will you keep it?
oh.
I think this is just pushing the dirt around.
I couldn't get the kid to fit her.
you know the kid toe shoes?
mmhm.
then you can just polish them.
but this stuff is satin and.
oh.
yeah they're just like the big girls!
you're a pretty big girl, aren't you?
what?
look how.

Judy's two?
what are you making, Sarah?

they look alright.
huh?
the things will be all anyway.
what?
I asked one of the women.
she has five children that are in it.
you know how she cleaned the toe shoes?
she said oh just a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
in other words find out for yourself, you know?
oh some of them are. they're all you know like.
trade secrets.
yeah you know?
foolish stuff.
somebody had to tell her, I suppose.
just a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
she wants Sarah to dance with her son next year.
I'll her.
a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
she'll get too.
what are you doing, Sarah?

when it dries out though you willn't be able to notice the spots on it huh?
that's true.
maybe.
what?
glue?
by the time you walk up three flights of stairs it'll probably be just as bad anyway.

you do it backwards.
what's that?
an sl?
start over here, Sarah and then pull your pencil to me and then down.
to me.
that's nope nope.
just like this and then down.
because that's the way you make a two.
that's why.
that's different from your usual one.
that's the one I wear down the beach.
it's just a cheap one for the water because I don't wanT To wear my rings in the water.

it looks like it though.
I was wondering about that.
I hide all the scotchtape and everything, ya know.
I had to use the. then I had to start using that crazy glue.
I wonder where I hid it.
because she'll go through a roll of Scotch tape like it's going out of of style.
oh that's great.
look at that.

now I can smell it.
yeah.
I thought it was a little cake icing maybe.
it could be if she did it up. believe me.
do you know what this is, Sarah?
I left all my ribbon down the beach too.
no I meant the present.
do you know what it is?
don't tell.
the next wedding present can be for Gail.
the bank.
put it in her bank for her.

gee that will never do.
we can't have one penny in there.
gee that will never do.

here, Sarah.
we wouldn't want Melissa to feel left out.
huh?
give her a dollar?
we'll stick with the pennies today.

I better wrap this again.
that's why she has to hurry home.
she's got supper.
she doesn't have time for tea anymore.
oh that's really pretty.
that's definitely a hers teacup.
Bill would break that at the first chance.
that's what we always give my sisterinlaw and her husband. one at.
that's what we always give my sisterinlaw and her husband. one at every Christmas because she saves them.
bone cup and saucers.
you know.
she wouldn't let him drink out of them to save his soul.
you are huh?
you have a birthday pretty soon, don't you?
when is your birthday?
there's no present there, honey, for Gail.

she didn't know a jack.
she knew an ace a king a queen.

what does a dog and cat do?
yes that's what the cat does huh?

and then what happens?
then the dog chases the cat huh?
but who starts it, Sarah?
who starts it?
that's right. Grampy's cat.
if he didn't go ssso like a cat.
if he didn't go ssso he wouldn't fight.
I have to laugh at my father.
I'd like to guzzle him.
what?
I'd like to guzzle him.
he spits at the dog and then of course naturally the dog's goING To chase him.
my father says.
that dog is chasing that cat again.
but the cat is supposed to be only playing.
then the cat'll get up and the poor dog'll just be laying there.
the cat'll get up on the chair.
the dog'll be under the chair.
he'll take his paw and he'll whack the dog. you know.
they don't see that.
they just see the dog chasing the cat.
so they think it's always his fault.
yeah it's always the poor dog's fault.

I can't wear the skirt.
it's too big for Mommy.

I don't know whether it's because she's got short arms or what it is.
but no matter what kind of a dress you put on her.

right that's today's date.
you tell me.
Sarah.

yeah.
you willn't get it out.
no that's not a very good idea.
what?
put a knife through it?
to get it out?
you could, I guess?
it's still not a good idea to fool around with that microphone.
do I like em?
if they work right I like em.
if they don't work right they make me very angry.
what?
sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't .
yeah.
I have no idea.

Gail doesn't bring me any money, she said.
if you'd like.
would you like to use the red pen?
here.
two lines down and two lines across.

dl ol.
nl.
nl.

you don't put the al on the other side.
put the al over here.
just because you don't have room for it.
hmm?
that's not right.
well if you know so much why don't you do it?
that's not the way you make it.
how's that?
goING To throw you out the window.

more than that.
I took those pennies out.
I put them in.

funny shape, isn't it?
like a circle?
mmhm.
because half of the tape is here and half of the tape is here.
oh we turned it on and it started spinning around and the tape went onto that one.
mmhm.
because the tape keeps going onto that one.
well watch it.
right.
and then it makes a record.
and then it makes a record.
mmhm.
that's the record if we're lucky.
we'll turn it on later and you can hear it.
that's a special kind of record.
a tape record.
nothing more than what we're doing.
no, lady.
don't touch any buttons, honey.
you'll be mincemeat.
you'll be in trouble.
can we make a shadow?

go ahead, Old_Lady. ask the bear a question.
that's a good one.
that's just right?
I think let's see.

whoop missed.
put your thumb in there.
and put your finger there. put your finger in the head.
