one of the interesting things about this with children of this age is that the mutual exclusiveness of the answers is not understood.
so that the the chance base is not fifty fifty.
I was wondering about that.
they quite freely will point to the same one for for both or to both at once or anything like that.
so you don't get that concept of of mutual exclusivity.
now what do we have here?
truck.
everything's a truck to you.
what color is that truck?
orange.

how does she know about a tent?
my cousin took us camping all the time.
oh.
and she sees their tents.
Sarah, did you ever sleep in a tent?
do you want to?

yeah I go in the car.
not in your car.
yeah.
watch your eyes.
a whale?
a whale?
where do whales live?
yup.
a sand shark.
what was it?
it was a sand shark on the beach.
Sarah thought all the kids thought it was a whale.
they all come up screaming.
there's a whale. there's a whale.
well it does look like a whale if you're this high.
cut a froggie.
cover your mouth.
I must be coming down with a cold.
Sarah, what did you do to your cheek?
does it itch?
is that the beginning of a froggie?
oh it looks like his house.
there.
we went to a wake last night.
and after the wake we went over to the Prudential.
my two cousins and I we decided you know to go over the Prudential for a cup of coffee.
well we went in. Shirley had a dollar. Eleanor had two and I had three.
the bill was five twenty.
what did you do?
then I had some change.
we had no intentions of going anywhere after the wake.
we come out. we walked, you know, all around and I figured it's so beautiful up there, the fountain.
I keep meaning to go up there.
oh it's swell.
we come out.
I had taken the Mass Turnpike in.
as you come up from the Mass Turnpike it said no parking.
so you know we parked and said.
let's get out of here.
so we were in about two hours.
we come out and we couldn't find the car.
did you figure it was stolen?
we couldn't find the parking lot.
we come out the wrong door.
we come out.
the back and the front look exactly alike.
uhhuh.
you know they've got the big escalators to go up and everything.
we couldn't find the parking lot.
we're standing there killing ourselves laughing.
for an hour we kept walking up and down up and down.
my poor cousin Shirley was so sick.
she had an awful cold.
we dragged her all over the place.
her feet were killing her.
finally we come against a guard up front you know.
he said.
I wondered what you three were laughing about.
we lost the car you know.
finally he said.
I don't know where you could've put it.
there's a little parking lot way down behind there. you go down. then you go up and down.
he said.
the cars always get towed away and it'll cost you eight dollars.
we didn't even have ten cents to make a phone call.
we were hysterical.
finally we found the car.
it was still there.
it was the same parking lot?
yeah.
the towing away one?
yeah they didn't tow ours anyway.
Sarah, when are you goING To learn how to drive?
yeah.
down at the Stop_and_Shop parking lot he had her sitting in his lap and she was steering the car.
are you good good at steering?
mmhm.
everytime I think about last I start laughing.
what?
every time I think of last night can kill myself laughing.
three idiots walking up and down the sidewalk.
oh.
you feel so silly and helpless.
we didn't know whether to go right or to go left.
nothing looked familiar.
we didn't know where to go.
we went to the ladies room and we had a dime.
I had a dime and I gave it to Eleanor.
she put the dime in the thing that you turn?
then instead of pushing it in she pushed it out and the dime went down you know.
just then the matron come in.
and Eleanor said.
well I put the dime in and the. you know I just can't get in.
the matron said.
you you didn't put a dime in.
oh.
oh it was awful.
we had a heck of a time.
anyway that girl was upset.
she went out and got in the next one and on the way out the woman said.
well here's the dime.
Eleanor.
by this time Eleanor was tearing you know.
and Eleanor said.
I don't want the dime.
but I put the dime in.
she said.
well she was right.
that's terrible.
they lose more money that way than by giving out a few dimes to people who put things in just as a matter of principle.
yeah Eleanor says.
I don't care about the old stinking dime but it was the only one we had.
and she said we didn't put it in you know.
next time I go to a wake with them I'm goING To make sure I take money with me.
Shirley was?
Auntie_Shirley went with me last night.
Auntie_Eleanor came.
everytime we go over there we get into trouble or something happens.
last time we got in the elevator.
my husband and I went, and Eleanor and her husband.
we got up in the elevator and pushed the button.
we weren't supposed to be up there anyway up on the seventh floor to look at the pool.
we pushed the button.
I don't know we pushed the wrong button.
it was the emergency button and bells were going all over the place.
we took off and left him standing there.
then we got locked in one of the rooms upstairs near the pool.
oh dear.
everything happens.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
her and her bright ideas.
Sarah, try holding it here and here and then you can move it wider.
see.
put your finger like this.
see how I hold it?
you're doing this and then you can't hardly squeeze it.
put it more at the end of your fingers and then you can cut better.
yeah maybe your fingers aren't long enough.
that's better though. there is better than there.
see if you can cut better like that.
I guess you're right.
pretty good.
it seems so funny to hold scissors that way.
way down here.

's small enough
.
my mother
opened the card
and
there
was
was
money
in it
you

so
Sarah
says to her
.
Nana,
you
can
spend
it all
too

will
she
buy
a present for you
with the bill
?
modesty takes over.
yeah.
hmm?
I
do
n't

what
you're saying
.
first
you
make a line
.
a straight line.
you know.
now
you
're
just
being funny
.
hmm.
it
looks more like an hl
.
she
made a tl this morning
.
she
was all excited
.
she
did
n't
expect
it
to
come
out
I
guess
and
look like a tl
.
if
it's so easy
how come
you
make all the mistakes
?
hmm?
come on.
that's hard work.
mmhm.
what is it?
it's a dress?
a dress for what?
for a person?
why
n't
ya make an apple
?
I don't know.
it
's an upsidedown apple
.
the stem
's at the bottom
.
what
do you think
?
I don't know.
it
looks
like
a six or a nine
or
something
.
what
do
you
think it is
?
I don't know.
well
it
did
n't
look
like
a wl to me
.
this is a wl.
that's a wl.
you copy it.
yeah
it
looks like a wl
.
what is it?
oh.
cl.
mmhm.
you
can
have
plenty of light
.
I
'll
turn the light on
.

.
Sarah,
what
does this spell
?
what
does that spell
?
can you spell it?
what
's that letter
?
you
know
what that is
?
sl.
that's right.
and
what
's that
?
and this one?
very good.
that one?
that's hard.
do
you
know
what
starts with a kl
?
what
what name
?
what name?
no this
is an fl
.
two lines and an el
has three lines
.
see.
an el has one
at the bottom
.
an fl doesn't .
oh.
you
'll
be
telling
the teacher
how to write
.
long as
she
could
n't
tell
why
this isn't a zl
.
let's see.
uhhuh.
what
comes next
?
I
think
that
's an accident
.
two
out of three
.
I
don't know, Sarah
.
you
never
hit
two out of three
.
and
what
's the last letter
?
that
's the middle letter
.
cl al
what
for cat
?
it
's
the letter
you
just
learned
how
to
make, the next letter
.
what
do
you
think you are
?
you're the teacher?
you think so.
yeah
I
think
that
is a little better
.
if you say so.
you're the teacher.
you're the teacher.
no?
what
did you do
?
no
you
show me
.
a door
a peanut door
?
a peanut what?
a peanut lollipop?
who
's eating it
?
is
there
a little girl
eating it
?
she
made
a mess of herself
?
I guess so.
I
had
all the summer clothes
put
away
in the suitcase
.
you
have
to
get em all out again
?
now
I
got
ta
take
all the summer clothes
back
out of the suitcase
.
huh?
most of em
probably
will
n't
even
fit
you next year
either
.
you
know
what
that one is
.
the one
you
have in your hand
?
no the orange one.
yeah
you
know
what
that one is
.
it
still
looks like a wl
.
you tell me.
you know.
no it
's not an nl
.
it's a what?
no.
when
you
turn
it
up
the other way
what
's this
?
this is an nl.
that
only
has two hills
.
two legs.
and
what
's this one
?
that's an ml.
ml.
yeah
like
m_and_ms
you know
.
you m_and_ms?
yeah
you
know
m_and_ms alright
.
not very much.
find the al
and
put
the al
in between
and
that
'll spell a word
.
there you go.
you
know
what that is
?
man.
no the other way.
yes.
that
doesn't spell any word
.
now
put that first
.
put the jl first
.
and
then
put
the al
.
the other side, Sarah.
put
it
after it
on
the other side
of the jl
.
this way.
now
put
the ml
after the al
.
it
has
to
go
the other way around
.
right.
ml.
you
know
what that spells
?
no.
I
knew
that
was
all natural
when
she
said cl al
.
it spells jam.
jam.
nothing.
the wall?
still nothing.
no
you
make
up
your own language.
I
'm afraid
.
you
're
goING
To
never
make
a word
out of that
.
there
's
no word
at all
that
starts like that
.
you
mixed
something
up
in there
.
that
's
a number,
not a letter
.
can
you
tell
which one's a number
?
which one?
no that one.
you and your letters.
I don't know.
yes it does
but
it's not a word
.
that
's
what it spells
but
it
doesn't mean anything
.
you
can
n't
put it like that
.
turn it around.
no
turn the el around
.
that's right.
turn it around.
that
's going the wrong way
.
that
sounds
like when uh.
I
think
it
was
Courtney one day
had a list
.
she
would say something
and
Sarah
would
have
to
repeat it back
.
like.
some darn thing.
I

I thought we were goING To share it.
I can't wear the skirt.
it's too big for Mommy.
let me see.
I don't know.

I don't know whether it's because she's got short arms or what it is.
but no matter what kind of a dress you put on her.

right that's today's date.
you tell me.
Sarah.

yeah.
you willn't get it out.
no that's not a very good idea.
what?
put a knife through it?
to get it out?
you could, I guess?
it's still not a good idea to fool around with that microphone.
do I like em?
if they work right I like em.
if they don't work right they make me very angry.
what?
sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't .
yeah.
I have no idea.

I don't know how he said it.
so Sarah said Gail doesn't give me any money.
Gail doesn't bring me any money, she said.
if you'd like.
would you like to use the red pen?
here.
two lines down and two lines across.
make it so you can see it.

you'll have to make it a little bigger than that.
so you'll know where to put the xl and the ol.
you'll have a zero?
oh ok.
what about me?
I think I remember.

so Gail won.
who taught you how to play this game?
who's she?

what does she remind you about?
hmm?
I haven't the vaguest idea.
it's a mystery to me.
what is it?

dl ol.
nl.
nl.
al.
you don't put the al on the other side.
put the al over here.
just because you don't have room for it.
hmm?
that's not right.
well if you know so much why don't you do it?
that's not the way you make it.
how's that?
goING To throw you out the window.
come here.

oh, that's not a chair.
at least not like that anyway.
I think you'd better take the watch back to Ursula.
you have to be careful or it willn't work properly.
Adam, let me see.
how did you attach that?
that's good.
shall we put this away and find something else?
we could put this in the box.
what is it?
careful, Adam.
show your Mother and ask her if it's safe.
I don't think so.
I know what you can do.
just take one paper and then find one that you'd like to make.

you come finish eating your cake.
it's a level.
it's a little game.

he's a little boy.
no, I'm not a fish.
no, I don't see any fish in here at all.
fish must swim in the lake.
I think there're some fish in the Charles River.
in the Charles River.
you know where the Charles River is.
I don't think so.
where we see the sailboats.
I don't know.
I don't know.
why should they come from Africa?
they live in Africa?
because Indians live in Africa.
I don't know where that come from.
where do you think these came from?

if you shoot him he won't laugh.
in the box.
not in there.
draw on the paper.
come measure the door.
careful.

I don't think there are any more pencils there.
what can we take down?
oh no, if you take the telephone down we won't have a telephone.
where's the key?
Robin lost the key to the door?
maybe one of my keys fits.
if you're careful.
can you find a key that fits the lock?
yes.
a house to a door?
you mean a door to the house?
somebody can walk in.
Adam, may I try it?
my brother took this off one of my doors
he said one of your brothers.
he didn't think this key would work.
the keyhole in your door is closed up.
I don't think that's the way you put it in.
I think you do it with screws and a screwdriver, Adam.
right there is one.
you had one in your pocket.
careful.
ok, that's enough.
careful.
Adam, you're just walking over her feet.
careful.
no no no, Adam.
you might break that off.
no, I don't think you should do that.
let's see if I could find a board around here and you might
put it on the board.
if you sit down you can.
careful.
yes, if you're careful.
where's my key?
are you going to put it on?
what do you need this for?
alright.
you put it in.
do it on the floor first.
put your lock in on the floor.
be careful and don't lose the screws.
ouch, Adam.
you don't need that.
I don't think you need that either.
ok, now you do it.
can you screw it with a screwdriver?
why not?
I'll hold it while you screw it
no, you don't need this at all.
what would you use it for?
no.
because we need that on the door.
it already has a lock in it, I think.
can you screw this?
that's part of the lock.
ok, we'll put that on
yes, that's to take it off.
no, you can put it in a little further.
no no, you don't need that.
put your screw back in.
where's your screwdriver?
have you looked in there?
look in there.
what do you see?
I see my Harvard shirt.
that's not a Harvard shirt.
look that way, what do you see?
look through the other end and see what you see.
wood?
wood on what?
you see the wood of the hammer.
wood or word?
we'll see what happens when you put a key in the lock.
yes.
whoops, you missed.
where do you put the keys?
is that the right key?
I don't know.
try that.
no no, don't push it in.
is it turned?
I'll hold it and you turn it and see what happens.
ok, Adam.
come in.
hello, Adam, how're you today?

you drew a picture once?
you don't have a mailbox up here.
to Robin?
alright.
that's very nice.
Robin will read it?
by himself?
he's been to school for one day.
why should he cry in school?
why would he want to?
because Shadow_Gay spanked him.
some little paper off?
well, draw on this.
you're going to do what?
a kitty's name.
look in the other end, Adam.
turn it over.
turn them around.
you can't see the cowboy that way?
careful.
let's see if I see you.
yes, I see you.
well, write on the paper.
well, don't write on it.
yes, a funny man.
no, you can't take it out.
he doesn't have any arms.
where do you think his arms are?
now how do you get the head over in the back?
the pen?
try to write with it.
is that a man?
why don't you write something?
with the pen.
write your name.
will read your name?
what do you write with?

what's the bird doing?
you have to put one up before you can put the other down.

she showed you one time.
whose name are you writing?

I haven't seen Shadow_Gay in a long time.
he went to Boston University?
oh, and what did he do there?
play?

and your bunny.
oh, is that Shadow_Gay?

fuddyduddy?
funny bunny?
Boodyc?
what's a Boodyc?
this is one of your tinker toys.
would you like to do the puzzle that was in this morning's paper?
ok.
you have so many pencils.
you lost your footie ballie.
do you see the puzzle?
I'm hiding, Adam.
I wouldn't know.
what did the puzzle say?
right here.
what?
I don't see the puzzle.
don't do that.
you might hurt yourself.
there isn't a puzzle this morning.
I don't know.
Adam, do you want to put this on the key chain?
let's see.
you come and look, Adam.
Adam.
come and look.
you hold the key.
this is where it has to go.
alright.
well, don't play with it.
how can you get it on?
no, I'm asking you.
no no, Adam, you'll break it that way.
maybe you just have to push it on, Adam.
you knocked my glasses off.
did it?
why did it frighten you?
I heard a little click.
click click click?
what about the door?
what's the governor's name?
my pocket.
I found a penny on the floor.
we don't need it?
what else do we need?
whoops, you missed it.
alright.
don't knock me.
if a carpenter knocks what does a plumber do?
who puts the door in?
a carpenter?
alright, carpenter Adam.
hmm?
I'm a nut?
did he say mmhm?
he was a nice carpenter, wasn't he?
you didn't get in his way?
oh very good.
what is that?
binoculars.
I'm waiting for you to put the other door hinge on.
you missed.
yes, three times you missed.
ok.
again?
how many times?
what do you do when you go to school, Adam?
what do you think Robin is doing in school?
playing with your bunny.
with your cowboy bunny?
cowboy hat in school?
some little screws in.
in the binoculars.
I don't really know that they're screws.
however it's put together.
I don't think you need to take it apart.
no, I think these must be David's .
perhaps his Mother bought them for him.
why not?
well, how can you throw them away and keep them too?
this one doesn't look like all the others.
yeah.
ok.
take it off.
yes.
yes, but I don't see another one like that.
shake all your keys inside and then just push down the snap.
no.
no.
to the door.
why we don't have a lock to fit the key.
because we couldn't find the key to fit it.
I guess we didn't buy the right one.
you know how this works, Adam?
do you see anything happening?
turn it the other way.
ok.
I'll get it started.
when you what?
no no no, not over there.
where's your rain hat?
yes.

maybe it's in the bag.
it's what?
oh, it's a game.
he just had a nap.
yes, that'll hurt him.
that will too.
he'll put it in his mouth.
yes, he puts everything in his mouth.
it's just where he had his head down on the blanket and it left a
well, sometimes you do when you wake up from your nap.
because you have your head in one place for such a long time.
are your hands washed?
don't .
he's telling a story.
no no, careful, Adam.
a frog.

no, the flowers aren't going anyplace.
they can't carry you anyplace.
oh, you wouldn't want to hang him up, would you?
why?
Paul would like that.
no no, don't throw him like that.
he likes to ride in the lake.
why don't you let him sit in the chair.
why don't you tell him a story.
do you know a story he might like?

do you want to watch, Adam?
is that right?
no?

yes, it should go in there.
very gently.
because he's small.

so that it willn't fall on anybody.
yes, because somebody could get burned.

what is this?
no, I don't have any cookie cutters at all.
are you going to make a valentine cookie?
Adam, how do you make the cookie dough?
you're making what?
bread?
yes, I guess.
no, she has nothing else.
finished?
alright.
yes, you may put that in there.
well, there're some more behind you.
here's another one.
shall I get the crayons?
whoops.
maybe we can attach it to two chairs.
shall I tie it from here to here.
alright.
yes.
oh, you have some pins.
shall I make it straight, Adam?
mmhm.
what?
I'll bring some handkerchiefs.
let's hang some Kleenex up.
oh, you're smiling back?
yes, you may use all you can.
why, I don't think you'd need to use all of it.
that's a nice white wash.
while your clothes dry?
this is the dining room?
oh, right here.
oh, that's the kitchen.
you have two kitchens.
why do you have two?
nothing.
I just put some out here.
why is Bozo going to eat with the chickens?
oh, he may spill the food.
oh, I didn't know you had any chickens.
playing?
playing?
you'll play cowboys and Indians after supper?
why are the Indians bad?
well, why are the Indians bad?
but that's the living room.
you said that was the living room and this is the kitchen and this
alright.
it's a nice kitchen.
I may look at them in the kitchen.
the bowl?
the bowl for what?
a beater.
you call it an egg beater.
what are we having for supper?
clotheslines.
just a minute.
you're going to have some water tea?
oh, thank you.
that's Ursula's .
you said this was mine.
that's very good tea.
oh no, I haven't finished that yet.
I had so much.
mine is so much larger than yours.
careful.
why is the kitchen right here?
no no no.
why is the kitchen right here?
no no no.
don't put that so far.
you'll be on the cord.
oh, Bozo's bottle.
thank you.
it's not ready?
under your rolling pin.
I think this is a cake knife.
this isn't a knife.
it's a fork.
I don't know.
it's such a small kitchen.
careful of the cord.
no, you didn't .
almost.
is the tea ready?
alright.
thank you, Adam.
I'll let it cool.
what do you do with a water hydrant?
oh, you don't have a small kitchen, you have a big kitchen.
no, I don't think so.
so what?
under the sofa.
why does your water come from the hydrant there?
what did you put in the trash can?
my goodness.
what kind of cup was that that you could put it in the trash can?
that's Daddy?
oh?
what kind of cake do you have, Adam?
buddy cakes?
what kind of cakes are those?
and what?
and smelly?
what?
here are two.
I see another one.
don't you see it?
over near your roller.
I'd like to know what kind of cake you're going to make here.
a dog cake.
I've never had any dog cake.
dog cake and picnic cake?
a dog cake must be a cake for a dog.
is that right?
Bozo is getting some supper for his meal for the chickens?
oh?
oh?
you're going out to the farm to get some eggs?
he did what?
he threw the egg at you and washed it?
oh, and the chicken caught it.
and gave it to Bobof to eat.
well, she's in the kitchen.
am I in your other kitchen?
alright.
oh, you want me to move?
I don't think it's broken, I think it just came out.
what?
no, it didn't break, did it?
those two are just alike.
well, how will the light keep Paul from waking up?
from waking up, yes.
that's from Pinocchio.
ok.
how long will it grow?
sixty dollars?
oh, you told the carpenter you had a big burp?
yes, it is.
what did the carpenter say?
you didn't understand what he said?
what did he say?
and what did he say?
you were talking to the door that?
you were telling the door that?
what else?
awoh.
you had an accident.
yes, you did.
I think you broke it.
well no, that's not yours, that Ursula's .
so what will you have to do?
you can throw it away if you want to.
I guess it's because you weren't playing with it gently enough.
mmhm?
be careful.
I may?
which way it were?
yes, that's right.
you did?
yes.
I think he's all finished by now.
I don't know.
perhaps he's finished too.
did he take his pencil sharpener?
whose pencil sharpener was that?
no.
I think perhaps he was going to put it up down there, wasn't he?
you did?
did you pick the screws up?
what does that roll like?
no, you have to turn it.
does it what?
not without breaking.
yes, you had an accident.
they're all clean?
Adam, did you open this package?
you opened it by yourself, didn't you?
alright.
would you like a pen?
a red one.
yes.
no, it's a red one.
yes, I did.
I ate my supper all up.
oh yes.
what does that look like?
careful.
I don't think it's lunch time, is it?
what makes you think it's lunch time?
why do you think it's lunch time?
why do you think it's lunch time?
how do you know?
how do you know that it's lunch time?
what statue told you?
I know when it's dinner time because I can tell time but how do
no, you cannot.
no.
I don't believe it.
there's nothing in this hand?
nothing in that hand either.
oh, you better put that back in there.
you go put that right back.
magician, yes.
no, he doesn't have one, does he?
be very careful.
your Daddy is going to get after you.
for taking this out.
from the baseball player, yes.
how can he play?
how can he play without a bat?
no no.
be careful, Adam.
it what?
what are you?
what kind of monster?
a sea green monster.
I'm a monster now.
what kind of monster are you?
a what?
a mompsyc?
what's a mompsyc?
no, I don't have any more.
who did use them all?
oh.
a boy what?
the light's green.
let's go now.
stop.
that's part of my body?
oh, what part is that?
just a minute, I need a pen from my purse.
I like to use a pen, don't you?
I have some things.
did you watch Captain Bob?
does he give you lessons?
what's a chicken?
he did!
alright.
how do you know she has any toys?
how do you know she has any toys?
it does.
because there was something on there.
there is one on.
alright.
I don't know.
what do you think it might have in it?
yes, oil and perhaps gas.
I suppose you can.
well, here it is, a picture of it.
yes, just like it.
perhaps if you put them as they were then they would all fit in.
is it an old truck?
no, I don't think it's an old truck.
no, I think that's the way they made it in the factory.
I don't know.
I suppose you can have in there whatever you'd like to have.
what would you like to have in there?
because it's a little truck.
that one can't be a bigger truck but there are bigger trucks.
why're you finished playing with it?
you're going to do what?
you're going to put it in with the lumber?
he's going to get prepared?
prepared to do what?
oh, are you the man?
oh, who's the man?
are you finished?
well, you just started playing with it.
I don't know.
are you finished?
I don't got nose bleed.
you lost what?
why don't you leave it on the floor?
better prepared.
it's a what?
hmm?
what is that?
anything carrying what?
he got some space.
some space for what?
you used to have little trains and you used to have one of those
there's one of the cars over there.
yes.
I really don't know that.
I think they must unscrew something and attach the hoses to the fire
we'll have to see some day.
oh no, we can't turn it on.
the firemen only can do that.
no.
because you're a little boy and I'm a lady.
we aren't men.
we can pretend, yes.
yes, we can pretend.
that's not a train.
that's a car carrier.
it carries cars from one place to another.
especially new cars.
it gets new cars from the factory and takes them to the place where
mmhm.
and Ramblers.
do you know any other kind of car?
other than a Rambler?
what kind do you know?
that's all?
the people at the factory who made the car painted it.
where are you supposed to park them?
you didn't put the gas tanks back on that truck.
oh, do you have a garage?
well, what're you going to do with these?
here, the tanks.
you're going to do what?
perhaps she doesn't have any more.
did you ever think of that?
no?
yes, they are tiny, aren't they?
I don't know.
poor Robin gets blamed for everything.
is that like the one in your book?
oh, Adam, that's not fair.
you just started playing with that.
is put the whole bag down here.
that's a bouncing ball.
you try and hit it with the paddle.
do you want to blow?
blow again.
blow one more time.
mmhm.
you're finished?
alright.
I don't know why.
yes, that's fine.
here's the bag on the floor.
see what?
do I see it rolling?
it's alright to leave the bag on the floor.
she has no more toys.
what?
do you want to blow?
what takes the car?
the car carrier.
what does a truck carrier carry?
no, you can't keep this.
see, you're supposed to try to hit the ball with the paddle in your
yes, you hit it.
pull it out like this so the ball goes up in the air.
yes.
yes.
where does the truck run?
where does the truck run?
to be prepared for what?
oh, which street?
I don't know.
why don't they go down Massachusetts Avenue?
and then what town will they go to?
so the man can see and not have a bump?
oh, they should have a bump.
why should they?
he can see the Rambler at dark_timec?
the what?
oh, the lumber.
my goodness, that car sure is pulling something big.
the cab.
the cab.
pulling the trailer.
he can't pull both of them, can he?
I don't know.
where are you going?
what kind of work are they going to do?
derrick work?
yes.
yes.
they should turn right.
yes.
mmhm.
yes.
yes.
they should turn right.
yes.
mmhm.
no, left.
mmhm.
I think they should keep going down Broadway street.
I guess the hitch is broken.
why?
because you need to have your nose wiped.
no.
because we need to use them.
no, there are no more.
that's the top.
the part that you open so that you can pull the kleenex up through
what?
because you put it on there.
he has a new little big trailer.
they don't burn it down.
oh mmhm.
can what?
you mean can a building burn down by itself?
yes, if someone starts a fire.
or if a fire is started in a building and the firemen don't come.
to put the fire out.
then the building burns down.
and who puts it back up?
no.
they don't build buildings.
I don't believe that.
how did they put it back up?
they put the fire out.
who?
yes, when they put the fire out.
to put another fire out.
putting the fire out at the school.
yes they put the fire out at the school, didn't they?
and then we saw the derricks tearing the school down.
yes.
because they didn't want the school to burn all the way down.
the hitch wasn't on properly.
yes, but you can only put one car in there now.
because it's in too far.
no.
I don't know.
what do you think?
do you think it's a doctor?
could be a doctor?
that's right.
can you put it back together?
where's the rest of the train?
no.
I don't know.
did you?
no, that was Daddy.
I guess so.
is that the caboose?
no?
how can you tell which one is the caboose?
yes, it is very very crowded.
you don't ?
why not?
oh, that's very kind of you.
mmhm.
somebody was laughing.
who was laughing?
a witch, you thought.
oh, I know that.
you just kid me all the time.
yes, you do.
yes.
yes, he's sleeping.
what?
he's sleeping down in his bed.
good.
no, I don't .
turn your paddle over.
good.
see if you can hit it again.
did you tell Ursula about your new doctor?
he did?
did he give it to you in your arm?
what?
no.
but you may be a doctor when you grow up if you'd like to.
oh yes, I think doctors enjoy being doctors.
what did you have in his office?
yes, he gave you a lollipop.
what color?
no, it was green.
yes, you have lips.
God.
you were born with lips.
no.
well, everybody has lips.
oh, that's a beard?
a what?
you mean a stethoscope.
like a doctor has.
let's see if I hear something.
what do you hear?
hear a what?
try to get your room straightened out.
you took them all down.
you did.
what makes you think she brought any toys?
yes, you made a big mistake.
you took what off?
no no no, don't crawl in there.
thank you.
put the wheels on the train.
alright.
except you are sliding in my trash.
here's another one.
oh my goodness.
and he gave his mother his milk.
are you a carpenter?
why do you do that sometimes?
what?
the mixer?
I don't know.
just a minute, please.
well, not in my trash, please, thank you.
no, you don't put your things all over the floor.
what is that you have now?
what kind of machine is that?
oh, the dirt dumps it in the pail?
yes.
yes.
oh, I see.
two trailers and one is behind the other one?
who was crying last night?
what do you think there is?
it's what?
what do you think it is?
what else?
oh yes.
pull it.
no?
here's a little hole.
why not open it from there?
open the whole thing.
what do you think it is?
what?
it's medicine.
yes, if she's sick.
yes.
it's a cough drop.
what is that?
no.
it's a microscope.
open the whole thing.
oh, you're opening the whole thing?
what is that?
why don't you read the directions first?
oh, you read it through the paper?
who is that?
don't you have a book about him?
what is that?
no, that's a popper.
a needle.
you know, like the one Dr Sherry gave you.
what do you think?
yes.
stethoscope.
hmm?
that's a microscope.
it's a microscope.
well, I don't think you're really supposed to put it down so far.
look through that little hole in the microscope.
can you look through there?
these are germs.
dirty water germs.
these are germs from dirty hands.
these are fingernail germs.
those are germs from dirty faces.
germs from dirty ears.
like a what?
I don't know.
why don't you put that in the doctor's kit.
that's a bag for going to call on people.
you can pretend to be a doctor.
oh, you left your germs out.
hmm?
are you done?
hmm?
Adam, you didn't put your cough drops in.
another what?
hmm?
sleep away?
what do you mean?
you'd like to do what?
obey?
obey whom?
oh?
do you want to listen to my heartbeat?
huh?
so closer?
aspirin?
hmm?
oh, you don't take my temperature that way.
you just take little children's temperature that way.
I take my temperature in my mouth.
did you ask Ursula?
you may have it if she says so.
well, you have it.
is he singing?
oh, he's thinking?
we'll let Adam examine you, like to check on Paul?
are you his doctor?
I'll pretend.
here comes Dr Adam.
he didn't even cry, did he?
he didn't even cry.
oh, you mustn't touch the doctor's bag.
examine Paul?
oh, is something wrong with him?
what is it?
oh, and that will make him stop waking up and crying?
listen to his back.
this is for checking very closely, this is a check to whether the
it's so small I can't even see it.
it came from the box, I think.
here are some signs for the office.
for your office.
this really goes under here.
you put it on there and you look through the hole.
can you see?
read what it says and you can see all of these germs.
the germs from the hands?
these are the germs from dirty hands down here.
surprise?
alright.
it what?
those are cherries, Adam.
which germs?
those are germs from dirty faces.
and here we have the germs from dirty.
what's the word?
dirty ears.
here we have germs from dirty faces
will I smile about it when I laugh?
what do you mean?
he's got your germs, Adam.
he's got your germ list.
you come back here.
he just wants to know about germs too.
well.
maybe he wants to be a doctor.
so he can help make people well.
yes, he's really just a baby.
he can't be a doctor while he's a baby.
he can just pretend.
like you can pretend.
like you can just pretend.
yes, you can pretend.
hmm?
well, because he's just a little baby and he doesn't know how to
well, because he's a little baby.
and he doesn't think like you do.
he's not as big as you.
because that's something that hasn't developed.
you're talking very quietly?
why?
no?
no no, Adam.
no no, Adam.
well, because he's just a little baby and he doesn't need to eat
you liked it, didn't you?
he likes it but it's not particularly good for him.
no, he doesn't need to taste it.
you tell him how it tastes.
and a what?
become a spider?
who is going to become a spider?
a spider what?
I don't know.
I thought you said something about become a spider.
oh.
there's a little boy over there who is sick who needs to be
in your bowling ball box.
he doesn't want to play.
so he must not feel well.
hello, Doctor Adam.
will you come to my house and check my little boy?
that's for checking the paper for seeing about dirty germs on your
is he alright?
well, what was wrong with him?
did he have a fever?
did he have a fever or a cold?
did he have pneumonia?
oh, he just had a little cold.
here's your money, Doctor.
thank you very much.
oh, Doctor.
I thought I only had to pay ten dollars.
how much do I have to pay?
some checks.
alright.
well, here's a check.
no.
you don't need any money.
no.
I just gave you some money, Doctor.
don't you see that money?
go get two pennies out then.
no, just two.
one two.
just two.
how many did you get out?
let's see how much you have.
no, Paul can't have pennies.
well, you keep three pennies and put the nickel back in.
here, you may keep three pennies.
put the nickel back.
put it back in the drawer.
alright, now you have five pennies.
Paul's going to be the doctor.
alright.
yes.
mmhm.
no, you put these through there.
what germ are you checking now, Doctor?
oh.
oh.
alright.
he can play with that one.
ok?
yes.
thermometer.
what?
ml al rl xl.
I don't believe I've ever seen that.
is that a new toy?
by Marx?
Paul, you come back over here.
you're just getting in your brother's way.
Adam's going to give you the block, Paul.
he's going to be a nurse and you're going to be a doctor?
ok.
oh.
what am I going to be?
where is Hans?
why don't you go get Hans and examine him?
examine.
alright.
is he alright?
got what?
alright.
you're the doctor.
you've examined Hans and he's alright?
well, my patient is alright too.
my patient is alright.
don't cry, Paul.
it'll be alright.
thank you.
what?
just as long as I'm holding him.
not by himself.
oh, will I?
what are you?
yes, it is.
it was even made by Indians.
that's right.
so children can dress up to look like Indians.
what?
yes.
yes.
what do you think they are?
they're not Santa Claus.
when you give Christmas presents you write the name of the person too
let me see it.
Santa Claus?
what does he have in his hand?
on his legs?
what are those?
mmhm.
sled?
oh, I don't know.
maybe he parked it some place.
he's going around looking to see if he can find some good little
Adam, you didn't ask Ursula if you could open that.
I hope so.
his name is Jocko.
Jocko.
he looks like a monkey.
it's a puzzle you know.
here are some more.
these come out too.
I see it.
why don't we take this up and you look and see if that's right.
see if those are in the right place.
what do you think goes there?
that's right.
now push it back.
no, that's not.
so that must not be right.
where do you think that goes?
close your eyes.
now look at it and see if you can find where it goes.
is that the shape?
that must be what?
do you see one that might look like a half moon?
I see it.
yes.
well, is that the way it goes?
yes, but it must not be the right way.
that's better.
I don't think that looks like a nose to me.
what do you think it looks like?
a heater?
what kind of heater?
a race?
what kind of race?
what does it look now?
yes.
my, doesn't it look like lots of things.
whatever it is there must be two.
those two look just alike.
one must go on one side of the head and one must go on the other
what do you think they are?
mmhm.
mmhm.
apple?
alright.
oh, I wonder what this is.
there are two of those too.
I see two shapes that look just like that.
on the puzzle.
a camera?
you put it where you think it goes.
alright.
I don't see it, do you?
alright.
alright.
I don't see it.
oh.
alright.
is that where it goes?
here's something we didn't take out.
these pieces?
oh, you want me to put all of mine in?
yes.
a little girl with a pinafore.
a little girl with a dress.
Jocko.
a monkey.
no.
I don't know.
yes, it looks like a wiggleworm but it's not a wiggleworm, is
I don't know.
could that be his tail?
he doesn't have feet like that, does he?
maybe that's a vine growing on the tree.
maybe that's a vine growing on the tree.
let's finish this first.
that's his tongue, isn't it?
the reindeer pulls his sleigh.
yes, perhaps he's parked them.
maybe he's parked all the others and he's just taking that one with
that's the, um
bottom of his boat.
well, that's his suit that he wears to keep him warm and that's
you may ask Ursula.
yes, they do.
Jocko.
I don't know.
poor Jocko.
he doesn't have a nose.
oh, he has a nose now.
he said thank you for the mouth.
not in that ear.
thank you.
yes, thank you.
I don't know.
where do you think it goes?
he's got his nose.
I don't know.
no, it came from this.
you must have broken it.
you probably stepped on it.
yes, that you step on.
what?
what?
that's right.
I think you did.
I think so.
yes.
yes.
it was an accident.
yes, it is.
no, not at all.
he doesn't understand.
he's too little to understand.
hmm?
I don't think you have to cut it.
maybe you can color it?
I don't think you need to color that.
it's fun?
I don't think.
another Ursula?
no no, Adam.
careful.
ok, I'm just going to turn him around and I'll come back.
oh, why did you put those in your doctor kit?
kit or box.
mmhm.
you lost some germs from dirty hands.
I don't know.
aren't they in there?
did you tell Ursula what we did yesterday?
don't you remember?
where did we go?
outside.
and what did we do outside?
not really, we just bought a loaf of bread and some eggs.
where did we go?
no, you don't need to cut them.
no, he lost his face, Adam.
what did the story say about sharing last night, Adam?
sharing toys?
with your brother.
oh no.
he wants you to play with that.
no, not if he's careful.
that might break.
this part looks like it's had an accident.
this is a bucket loader.
he what?
like a mitten.
did you put your puzzle back together, Adam?
Jocko?
show Paul how it goes.
Paul has never seen his face.
Jocko's face.
put it together and then show Paul.
he'll like that.
that's alright.
let's play over here.
ok?
no, honey.
let's put Jocko together.
and then we'll look at some books.
maybe Ursula brought some of Robin's books.
let's put the puzzle together and pick it up first.
oh, he only has half of his ear.
now he has two ears but no face.
right into a lobster!
where's a lobster?
Paul, Adam is putting Jocko together.
then we can look at some of Robin's books.
no no.
what did Daddy say about throwing that ball, Adam?
no, he said he wanted to find the ball right where he put it.
mmhm.
you hit Daddy with the ball and he told you to leave it up there.
hmm?
why are you taking him apart?
ok.
what, sweetie?
there it is over there.
yes, he needs an ear.
he needs two ears so he can hear what you're saying and a nose for
he can't talk yet, he doesn't have a mouth.
he can't see you because he doesn't have what?
I don't know.
guess you must have lost his eyes?
no?
where are they?
I don't see them.
mmhm.
mmhm.
you didn't need your scissors, did you?
there they are.
you didn't tell Ursula yet where you went yesterday.
we rode in a taxi and you sat in a chair.
where were you?
can you tell her about your visit to the dentist?
is that your first time?
yes.
what did the dentist say to you?
what did she tell you?
that you had no what?
no cavities.
you don't have any cavities at all, do you?
that's very good.
yes.
yes.
this is one of Robin's favorites.
what do you think it might be?
what is that?
isn't that a funny book?
what was that?
butterfly.
and what lives in there?
what lives in that house?
you have to ask Ursula.
airplanes.
yes, she said it was an airplane.
that page is gone.
just open the flap and you will see.
that's a rhinoceros.
were you coming to me?
what is your problem?
Paul would you like to see the book?
seals and fish.
when you step on things you break them.
no.
let's see if it still stands up.
what are those?
yes.
yes.
what does he sell?
what does he sell?
icecream for boys and girls.
alright.
no, I don't think that's a hippopotamus.
isn't that a rhinoceros?
why don't you look at another one?
my goodness.
you're a donkey?
you're a donkey pulling a wagon.
where're you going with the wagon?
what?
because I'm going to put the door on.
oh, Joe.
French Joe.
I hope it doesn't come out.
so they willn't fall out.
that's lumber?
I don't know.
let's see.
that backs the dirt out?
oh, it doesn't go there?
where does it go?
no.
well, I just picked it up off the floor.
right.
are they all named Joe?
huh?
that's what what?
oh, it does?
in that little tiny hole?
oh, what happens after it goes down there?
what?
box?
each other?
thank you.
not very well.
for seeing?
Ursula.
no, I think that was before the games.
careful.
well, give it to her.
you have to look and see.
can you open the bag?
what is he doing?
no no no.
you don't do that.
you have to turn it.
oh yes, if you put it down.
he's walking, isn't he?
ask Ursula what his name is.
he doesn't have one yet.
we have to ask permission first.
now you blow through the hole.
try it.
there.
see?
no.
for the bubbles to go in there?
I don't think they'll go in there.
did she put that there or did you do it?
what happened to it?
blow very gently.
blow gently.
that's right.
what happens when you catch them?
blow gently.
if you blow gently I think you'll get more.
don't put it in your mouth.
why don't you hold it?
I don't know.
I didn't see you.
did you?
if you want to.
now, what if you blow them up in the air?
no, it didn't go there.
blow it up in the air.
he can see.
don't put it in your mouth, honey.
because it was so pretty.
no no, Adam.
don't put it in your mouth, honey.
Adam, we'll have to put it up if you put it in your mouth again.
it doesn't taste good, does it.
Paul sees that one.
blow gently, Adam.
see.
it's all gone.
do you have it?
let's see.
no, Adam, we can't play with it any more if you're going to
no, you put it in your mouth.
here's one over here.
gift.
what kind of gift?
no no.
what's happening?
look at his feet.
slippers.
so his feet willn't get cold.
you can use that ball for bowling.
those are all the same colors.
what?
is the ball you were speaking of in the box with the bowling pin?
well, go see if it looks like that.
because he likes to.
why would you do that?
oh, but he's very talented.
he can play two.
oh, you made a mistake?
how did you lose yourself?
why do you say Ursula's words?
what's that?
oh yes, I see.
are they turning?
bowling pins.
what color?
what color is that?
no, this is blue.
is there a blue one?
what color is that ball in your hand?
green.
yes, I'll bowl with you.
yes, we knocked them all down.
because that's the way to play the game.
you have to turn it around so that it matches.
look at all of your and see if you have one that matches.
no, that has four.
would it fit anywhere else?
no.
you put one out first.
you have to match it.
why don't you make what you want, and I'll make what I want.
hmm?
it is?
I don't know.
what is it going to carry?
what?
I think that's nice that you're not crying.
amen.
I was thinking of a funny story.
did you tell her about your visit to the pet shop?
what did you see at the pet shop, Adam?
puppies.
he's giving them names.
only it didn't have a mask over his eyes.
yes, you're silly.
yes, silly billywp, willywp, dillywp.
what is your name?
did you see turtles?
at the pet shop.
what else did you see?
fish?
and what else?
no, you saw something else.
something in cages.
and what else?
yes.
I don't think so.
well, nothing might happen.
I just didn't think you'd like to have a kitty.
what are you singing about?
ok.
they willn't fall out.
because the door isn't wide enough.
no, I said wide enough but big enough is the same.
you ate the snake up?
was he good?
oh, in the bunkhouse.
what did you do?
yes, turtles crawl.
yes, snakes crawl.
I guess they walk, yes.
I really don't know, Adam, if you want to be so specific.
I think so.
that's something from last time.
when you were playing upstairs.
I don't remember, what was in it.
why don't you let one of the Joes drive.
is this Joe?
oh, this is terrific.
Joe terrific.
and the other one he says is just Joe.
perhaps the other Joe would be a better driver.
he was in your truck.
I don't know.
could he sit beside him?
he can ride in something else.
it's a what?
yeah.
was that another one getting some fire?
red street light.
you have to stop.
green light, you may go.
yes.
bring the can up to here.
the whole thing.
blow gently now.
no no Adam.
don't put it in your mouth, dear.
it's not to eat.
what do you think it is?
what does it look like to you?
can't you tell the truth?
what does it taste like?
what do banjos taste like?
no, those are bowling pins.
for what?
no, nothing goes in there.
those are bowling pins.
so who can see it?
no, I don't need to see it.
I know what it looked like.
no, Adam.
we have to put it up.
no, you don't need to play with the can right now.
why do you want to put it in your mouth?
very good.
oh my goodness.
where're the firemen?
oh, he did.
oh, very good.
now what happens?
a house?
yes, I think so.
he'd like to get down on the floor and knock all your toys down.
isn't that right, Paul?
stop that, Paul.
oh my goodness.
there are lots of houses.
how many do you have?
oh yes, I see.
where're they going?
oh.
oh.
get what?
oh, that's a nice little door.
ok.
do they live with each other or next to each other?
they've got what?
ladies?
at their homes?
oh, they're going in?
who's there?
fireman who?
oh, I don't want you to knock because you might burn my house down.
oh alright.
come in.
oh, that was a fireman's boy?
no, they're going to put the fire out so that it willn't burn the
well, they weren't built very well so they have be built again.
oh, they're going to build them this time.
when the ladder gets up there?
they have to get a ladder to build a house?
a chimney?
for their aunts?
oh yes.
oh, it's closed?
oh, very good.
I think that's very nice of them.
Paul, are you going to sleep in the bed because you're tired?
oh yes, he is.
he just woke up and had his bath and his breakfast and then he played.
so he's tired.
yes.
he's so tiny that he doesn't really know that it's not nice to knock
he just thinks it's fun to get the toys.
did you tell Ursula where we went yesterday?
you know where we went yesterday.
I'm not going to tell you.
you tell me.
where did you go, Adam?
is that the truth, Adam?
I don't believe that's the truth.
don't you remember where we went and what we saw?
a Dick Tracy car.
what else did we see?
where were you, Adam?
can you tell her what else you saw?
now that it's all fixed what else did you see?
we walked and Paul was in the stroller.
he can't walk.
he's too heavy for Mommy to carry.
I'm not going to tell you but I know.
I'm not going to tell you.
I know.
what I saw yesterday.
I'm not going to tell you because you saw it too.
well, tell us, what did you see?
well, we walked all that way just to see a Dick Tracy car and
and what else, Adam?
that's all!
Paul saw some nice things.
I don't know.
you don't seem to remember.
Paul, what did you see?
we went to the Boston Common.
careful, careful, careful.
it's my coat.
it is not.
is there a lady like that at nursery school?
there must be a lady with a jumper on at nursery school.
what's her name?
you can't tell the truth.
you're jumping rope.
did you finish moving your furniture?
you have a cough, don't you, Adam?
yes.
what do you think the Doctor does when he's sick?
did you check yourself?
you did?
are you making a train?
yes.
yes.
what?
you do.
what about one of these pens?
alright.
no, you can't write on those.
I'll give you some paper.
oh, can you do that?
no, she doesn't want to listen to a record.
here's some paper.
what does it say?
Adam, will you have swordfish tonight?
he had some yesterday.
oh, thank you.
what shall I write?
here's something to write on.
where did you put your pen?
what?
he said it's not.
do that again.
I don't think there is an eraser on that.
he has a long head like a string?
that looks just like a wiggleworm.
yes, it does look like a bear.
how many eyes?
four eyes and what?
and one half?
with a big wiggle?
oh?
that's nice.
what is it now?
a broom?
do you sweep?
a wolf?
yes, I guess that looks like a wolf.
it looks like a wolf.
there are his ears and there's his nose.
nothing.
see?
oh?
a swordfish.
a whale?
what kind of a whale is that?
oh, it's a baby whale.

not an ugly duckling at all.
but what?
don't you remember?
a beautiful

corn?
no.
the ugly duckling turned out to be a beautiful white
swan.
what did he find on his head?
no, that's where the acorn hit him and he went to tell the king.
what do you think?
guess.
who is Pokey_Wokey?
I don't know that story.
I don't know.
but who is that?
oh, Pinocchio.
guess.
you didn't guess.
you guess.
no.
you want another guess?
that's Rumplestiltskin right there.
no, draw on the paper.
what is that?
I don't know.
what do you think?
oh, a mail bag.
for the postman?
you do?
no, what did you make?
a train?
oh, that's a nice train.
except what?
the conductor is on the other train?
well, what is that on the back of the train?
a log truck?
here it is.
here's a piece of paper for you to draw on.
alright.
I don't know.
I wrote it down there.
can you read it?
yes, you wrote it too.
so you should be able to read it.
two fish?
why do we need two fish?
got sick?
some flowers.
did he say no thank you?
no.
he said thank you for the flowers.
don't tear it.
oh, that's nice isn't it?
ask your Mother, Adam.
yes.
you guess what it is.
well, I guess you can just pull the paper.
that was a big pop.
what do you think it's for?
Adam, I think you do it on the other side.
you can?
what is that?
oh, that's nice.
are what?
lions.
the other what?
at the other end.
turn it over.
use that on the other side.
that's what you call chalk.
no, not for putting in the mouth.
no, not Chocks chalk.
no, you use the crayon on that side.
where's the box?
yes, they are both white, aren't they?
but you don't use that on that side.
you use that on the green side.
no no no.
you either use the chalk or the crayon.
on the other side.
where's the eraser?
are you sitting on the eraser?
now do you want to wipe that off?
all of it.
and then draw some more.
no, that doesn't go in with the crayons.
oh, if you wish.
like that one?
that's not really a ship, is it?
what is that?
but you can draw a sailboat.
mmhm.
what?
mmhm.
no the other way, that's right.
just like you use the crayons.
what're you looking for, Adam?
you what?
you were just joking?
you can hang it up on your wall?
you can keep it.
that's for you.
yes, that's part of it.
if you look down at the bottom of the bag there's something there
this is for Paul she said.
I didn't hear you ask her if you could open that.
yes.
goodness, what do you think those are?
wheels?
oh, what do they go on?
so you can tick it?
I don't hear it ticking.
I don't know.
you'll have to figure it all out by yourself.
isn't that fun?
well, why don't you see what you need for it first.
that's a dairy.
that's the dairy.
no, that.
what is that?
I can't read them right now.
could I see it?
you need to put the wheels under both holes.
on the other side too.
the other side now.
yes.
put it in the hole.
this isn't a doggie.
mmhm.
why?
there's another truck.
yes, you missed it.
yes, just like the other ones.
now you have to lead the trucks.
all those little things there.
well, I don't know.
what do you think they might be?
hmm?
boxes of what?
they seem to, don't they?
well, that's not really a clock, is it?
just the dairy products around here.
see the eggs the milk the butter.
I guess you could read that and it will tell you what those things
he said I want that.
I don't know.
he sees something back there that he would like to have.
you don't have any milk on that truck.
the truck you're driving.
yes, they seem to, don't they?
I don't know.
you find out.
that's right.
now, why don't you put some butter on the truck?
what about some milk?
yes, that's milk.
I'd like four quarts of milk.
now, how're you going to put it on there like that?
four quarts of milk and two pounds of butter.
ok, Mr Milkman.
I'm waiting for my four quarts of milk and my two pounds of butter
and if you can't bring it I'll just have to get another milkman.
no, you don't have what I ordered.
I said four quarts of milk.
where's the milk?
do you have four of those?
no, you don't , do you?
how do you think they go on the truck so they willn't tip over.
they might spill like that.
yes, I think I'm going to have to get another milkman.
I don't want any butter that might fall off the truck.
but you don't have what I asked for.
you've got the two dozen eggs on properly.
no, those are eggs.
they're on properly.
they willn't fall off and break.
I like to bake cakes and cookies and I need butter.
and I like to have toast and butter for breakfast.
well, you don't need to bring me any toast, Mr Milkman.
just my two pounds of butter.
I don't know, Mr Milkman.
I might have to get another milkman.
yes, see.
you lost my butter on the street.
what did you say, Adam?
where're you going to put my butter?
perhaps it would stand up too.
the other way.
I think over.
yes.
now what about loading the other truck?
yes.
oh, that's not nice.
I need lots of milk, Adam.
no, I think that milkman might be alright now.
I guess he was new at the job.
no.
would you close the door, please?
freedom.
oh, now I know where this goes.
does this go here?
oh, why would you do that?
why don't you put the extra butter and eggs on here.
well, why don't you pick those up off the floor first and put those
you're sitting on a quart of milk.
oh, I don't think you meant to.
a pound of butter and a dozen eggs over there.
mmhm.
now, do you know what these are?
these are houses.
people who want milk and butter and eggs.
I'd like one quart of milk.
and a dozen eggs.
one dozen eggs.
alright, thank you, Mr Milkman.
goodbye.
hello.
I'd like three quarts of milk, please.
mmhm.
there's a quart of milk.
mmhm.
what?
two pounds of butter.
guess.
that's where you keep your milk.
I'd like two quarts of milk, please.
two quarts of milk.
hmm?
perhaps so.
no, I don't think that's a sailboat.
where's the boat and where's the sail?
what?
does it ship?
what do you mean?
not really, he's just trying to use me for a ladder.
don't put your tongue out like a snake.
yes, that's what Paul did.
do you remember what Paul calls you?
what does he call you?
no.
no, what does he call you?
no, what does he call you?
doesn't he call you his brother?
hmm?
how many quarts?

you almost did.
your nose what?
blown?
alright, go get a Kleenex.
wait.
your Mother did.
Adam, can I order some milk?
I need three quarts.
oh no, I need three quarts.
that's not three.
why can't I?
I need another milk, thank you.
I'm finished with this one.
oh?
they all what?
no, they have not.
heard something.
oh, those poor eggs.
must be broken.
must be broken because they fell from the truck.
yes, I guess so.
oops.
they're not?
very good.
oh well, he must be a new milkman.
no no, don't write on the floor.
no, those are not broken.
where're you going to put those?
where does what go?
what is it?
a dozen eggs?
put them in the dairy.
said no, he said that he's Paul.
he's just a little baby.
he doesn't understand that big brothers don't always like for little
pat_a_cake.
can you do pat_a_cake, Paul?
do they sell scrambled eggs?
oh my goodness.
oh, they sell ham.
what kind of ham?
very good.
ok?
oh my goodness.
why don't you put all of those from one truck into the dairy farm?
here's a quart of milk over there.
ok.
you have a street light.
you have to stop, Mr truck driver.
ok, green light.
yes.
stop.
a red light.
green light.
you may go.
oh, Mr Milkman.
would you please give me one quart of milk and one pound of butter?
ok.
no, I said one quart of milk and one pound of butter?
I'm waiting, Mr Milkman.
no.
thank you.
yes.
two dozen, yes.
see if you can put it on top of there.
what's that attached to your belt, Adam?
does it have a snap on it?
yes, that's a snap.
no.
no, he can't play with it.
oops.
yes.
yes.
the milk broke too.
it's not broken now?
ok.

how do you get one half milk?
how can I have half a quart of milk?
would you give me one half quart of milk?

I don't think you want to serve me.

I guess so.

that was my garage.
he might hurt himself on this.
no, just to stand up.
no no, Paul.
oh, you're shoveling the snow off?
yes.
careful, Adam.
don't hit Paul on the head.
do what?
oh no, don't hit him with that.
that might hurt him.
oh, that wasn't very kind to do.
he's too big to jump through that hole, don't you think?
I'm too big to jump through that hole.
no, you're too big.
the hole is too small.
did you go to school this morning, Adam?
yeah.
yes?
one more.
hhmm?
did you turn it over?
is there anything on the other side?
no.
you put them anywhere you want to on the other side.

look and see.
mhm.
that's a kl.
do you know what that is?
bl.
what is it?
bl.
that's right.
good for you, Adam.
what do you think it looks like?
I don't know.
it looks like an xl.
would you like an apple?
I like apples.
yes, you may eat that one.
that's right.
you were just playing with Paul?
did you tell Ursula what happened in the barber shop?
what happened?
ok.
what happened in the barber shop?
she wets my hair.
after it's cut?
yeah.
oh good.
what are you looking for?
look for dese sticking out.
oh, what's that?

I didn't say you're cute, I said that's a ql.

Adam wants Ursula to see if you can walk.
you aren't big enough to play that game.
like a what?
a camel.
like a camel?
yeah.
he can talk?
yeah.
what can he say?
da da.
he can?
yeah.
can you understand him?
I can understand myself.
I hope so.
oh, that's nice.
no, I don't think so, does it?
I don't know about that.
don't you turn it around?
no.
no.
no.
why is it easier to do it that way?
oh?
that's alright.
I almost sat on Paul, he moves so quickly.
you're not big enough to play the game, Adam says.
oh, he'll play a game with some blocks.
three two what?
dot dot.
do you remember what you told Mommy about this?
you said it was an al upsidedown.
no, that's properly.
but it wasn't an al at all, was it?
it was a vl.
you're not big enough to play the game yet, ok?
he thinks he's grown a little.
hhmm?
because they're just babies.
what're you going to do with that, Paul?
I see it.
mhm.
well, I'm sorry, Paul.
you'll have to grow a little.
yes.
no, I put that there for you.
you might be able to see what you write better if you use that.
I don't understand why you want that.
oh, he's grown enough?
yeah.
ok.
I'll play over here with him so he willn't bother you.
ok.
well, come on.
a small bug and what?
big bug.
the big bug?
what kind of bug.
just bug.
oh, what do bugs like to eat?
who is Michael?
I don't know.
oh, he goes to nursery school?
Adam, what about your board over here?
how are you doing with it?
I ready.
no, I don't think so.
this morning?
yes.
he didn't play with anything this morning.
he went to sleep this morning.
this morning?
he was playing with the cow.
Adam, no no, not in his face.
she turned the direction so she could hear better.
careful, don't push him down, honey.
Paul, why don't you come over here.
Adam, can you spell your name over here?
look here.
Adam.
can you put these letter on here?
I can't make those hl.
you don't have to make it.
I mean with these.
mhm.
let him look at one.
here, Paul.
what is this, Adam?
a channel.
no, he does not.
when does Walt Disney come on?
I don't know.
he comes on on Sunday.
no, just Sunday.
we saw a funny program, didn't we?
about a funny dog.
yes.
yes.
they were shooting at him and the in the stall was what?
wolf.
no, a big bull.
and the dog got frightened of the big bull and backed out.
bull?
yes.
no, I don't think he'd like you in there either.
yes.
careful, Adam.
you're heavier than Paul.
you might hurt him.
what else happened?
do you remember the name of the story?
yes.
what was it?
a funny cartoon.
it's about Hector.
the stowaway pup.
yes, it was.
why are you doing that?
is that the way you dash away?
no, Paul.
what are you eating?
apples.
why are you eating an apple?
do you know why?
why?
I don't know why.
do what?
I do hl.
do you know what that is?
hl el.
no, do you know what this spells?
mine says pl al ul ll.
what does that spell?
me said tl vl el il ll.
what does that spell?
pl ul il ml ol.
this is Paul's name.
see?
that's Paul's name.
let's see if I can find enough letters to spell your name.
d a l e.
that's your name.
ok.
hhmm?
whose glove is that?
yeah.
that's Ursula's glove.
you have pretty gloves?
yeah.
who said your gloves were pretty?
myself.
this is another word, Adam.
that's hl el he.
here's another word.
her.
here's another word, Adam, look.
Paul, you come over and play with this.
that's for big boys Adam said.
what is that?
hl.
a snail?
yes.
what does a snail do?
I think that's the number six.
no, this is channel two.
this is two.
where is four?
what do you mean?
poor Paul.
you're having a hard time.
thank you.
that's alright.
he can play with a few.
yes, maybe he's big enough now.
how is what?
dat.
oh, why don't you go get some?
dey right here.
what do you mean channel four stops on two.
why are you hiding behind there? four goes here.
what goes next?
channel ol goes next.
what is that?
tl.
that's kl.
Mrs Bekaer.
well, kl starts with key, yes.
no, they have to be like that.
what does vl sound like?
dl.
do you know what that sounds like?
Adam, will you say one two three four?
you say it.
oh yes.
that's alright.
something's sticking out on the tape recorder?
what do you think it is?
do you have a Harvard shirt on?
what?
oh, the dresser is hurting your head.
why are you putting your head on the dresser?
does it still hurt you?
it what?
Adam, maybe you can use these.
you have some?
where?
what colors do you have?
red and blue?
anything else?
hmm?
well, it'd be nicer to leave the box there and just take them out.
if you leave the box there then we'll know where it is.
alright.
would you get your handkerchief, please?
what did you see on television last night?
did it have a lion in it?
did it have a scarecrow in it?
did it have a wizard in it?
that's right.
can you?
I don't think so.
it's glued on there, isn't it?
do you know why those people wanted to go see the wizard?
you don't know?
you don't know why?
they each wanted the wizard to do something.
do you know what the lion wanted?
handle it very gently.
you can open one end.
yes, you open it.
now let's see.
the stick
attach rubber.
we have to attach it to this little hook.
I'm taking out the tail part.
I think you can take this piece out too.
really?
alright, Adam.
take this piece off very carefully.
these we put into here.
these are wings and we're putting them into the clip.
mmhm.
no.
this is the wing.
and another wing.
I'm taking the end off.
then they can attach by themselves.
we're putting this clip onto the stick so it will go like an.
it's not easy.
no, it's not so easy.
oh, I see it did.
now you turn the propeller many times.
ok, let's try it.
you try it.
now hold it up in the air and let go.
it's a Sky_Dart.
the same way you put it together.
oh no.
why don't you leave it together?
oh, a bit more.
a Sky_Dart.
Paul, Adam's talking to you.
do it more until it's tight.
no, it doesn't have wheels.
sometimes.
well, it's not a regular airplane.
it's what you call a Sky_Dart.
that's why the wings aren't straight.
hmm?
see, Paul.
mmhm.
thank you.
he didn't give me anything.
I took some paper from him.
I took it from him.
the tail.
the rudder.
no?
which part don't you like?
alright.
you can have it straight.
wind it many times.
that makes it fly.
that's right.
well, don't hold the rubber band.
because then you keep it from turning.
no.
no no, don't let Paul get it.
that's right.
well, he likes it but he doesn't know how to handle it carefully.
you aren't holding the rubber band, are you?
it turns too.
see how the band is being twisted?
the wings don't turn, do they?
what are those?
I thought you said that was a propeller.
no, it was right but it fell on its tail.
on a caboose?
what kind of caboose?
you need to hold it up like this.
thank you.
I guess when it hits the floor it hits so hard that it falls off.
mmhm.
I heard it.
that's the place to attach the dart to the propeller.
no?
why?
it thought your arm was a tree.
why did it think that?
you didn't hold it up high enough.
first you wind it many times
then you hold it here and here and let go.
Paul wouldn't know what to do with an airplane.
I don't think I would, Adam, because it's not very strong.
you willn't cut your finger, what?
oh yes, when it snaps.
that's a strong rubber band.
oh, did it break?
not in that, but people get in real airplanes, don't they?
it doesn't fly all by itself.
you help it by turning the propeller.
I just don't think that Paul is interested.
where?
are there any children?
oh.
you made it?
who made it?
oh, you made one.
mmhm.
a little boy named George.
and he had a sister named what?
no, Tony was the little baby.
his sister's name was what?
the little girl.
her name is Sheila.
Sheila.
careful, Adam, you may break your airplane.
mmhm.
your Sky_Dart.
the what?
you don't ?
well, are you being very very careful with it?
it fell on that, on that part, Adam.
those are bright tone crayons.
careful.
pick the one you dropped on the floor up.
what do you think that is?
they're all black?
I'm asking you.
no, they aren't all black.
yes, I think that's black.
no, the paper is.
some of the paper is black.
but that's yellow.
the yellow black thing.
I don't know why the black should be on the yellow.
all the others have their own color.
maybe they made a mistake
oh, honey.
yes, you made a mistake.
no, Adam.
careful, honey.
fell, went over you.
what are you going to do with it?
oh, Adam.
an airplane fell on your little brother.
Adam.
Adam.
did you make another mistake?
you're pushing Paul.
will you take those and put them back in the crayon box, so they
yes.
why would you want to break them?
you don't like crayons?
you think that is meat?
what kind of meat?
you made two of that, Adam?
hmm?
because you took them out.
that has two ends and evidently you opened both of them, now where
you magicked them?
where did you magic them to?
you mean you made them disappear?
who has to leave and get them?
oh, the airplane does.
alright.
you don't want it to fall.
well, I need my bricks if I have to build my building.
your hands are what?
yes.
you weren't such a magician after all, were you?
well, these are Paul's .
I'm giving these to Paul.
no no.
he has blocks too, you know.
here, Paul.
let him have one block while you build your building.
thank you.
mmhm.
this is my building over here.
I didn't knock mine down.
so I see.
no no, Paul.
you'll cut your little fingers there.
he's just a little baby.
he can't play well yet.
watch the propeller, Paul.
Paul, can you say airplane.
Paul, Adam wants to know if you can say airplane.
alright.
this is your house.
it fell apart again.
it's going to fall apart?
why?
well, because it's just a little Sky_Dart.
no, why would you take it apart?
oh?
my what?
I put the men in my house?
in the airplane.
alright.
go in the airplane.
well, he's too fat.
I don't think he can go in the airplane.
I wouldn't laugh about that.
they're too heavy.
are you ready, Adam?
no, it didn't break.
what?
now how can you fly the Sky_Dart?
well, don't break the airplane.
ok.
you can't sit on Paul, dear.
he's not quite big enough yet.
now what do I do?
one two three four.
what?
Paul, Adam says it's your turn.
you take Paul's turn because he can't do that.
I'm watching.
why do you think it does?
he what?
no, be careful, Adam.
no, you didn't .
you hit the side of the chair.
you don't throw blocks, you know.
no, you don't .
alright.
you may make them ski just two at a time.
no no, Paul.
where's your handkerchief?
oh yes.
wait a minute.
close it up.
that's right.
you can.
oh, shall I show you?
yes please.
you hold him down here and squeeze and it makes him jump.
you squeeze and then let go.
is that what he's doing?
because he's holding on by his hands.
you show me how.
what do I do?
oh, I see.
oh, he's clever isn't he?
let's call him Clever the Clown?
well, you didn't finish playing with this yet.
pull it out and see.
oh, careful.
you look like a Chinese princess.
a blonde wig.
it's a wig.
why are you backing away?
look at this, Adam.
I like this.
what do you suppose this is?
a lion!
do you think that's a lion?
look at it again.
what do you think he is?
no, that doesn't look like a lion.
yes, it looks like a leopard.
that's the way he fights.
that's the way he has to get his food.
if he's in a cage.
no, I don't think so.
yes, he may try.
it wouldn't fit me.
I'm a little too big.
you've seen people wear those, haven't you?
a what?
uniform?
what kind of uniform?
no, you're asking me.
no.
well, that's part of the dress that some people wear.
remember in your book.
I think it's Chinese.
that was an accident.
oh, come on.
put it on.
let me find a mirror so you can look at yourself.
oh, you'd like me to buy a dress like that?
that's pretty, isn't it?
a dragon.
I don't think so.
what?
there were two other ones.
so two people can play.
yes.
oh.
yes, that's almost all.
you do.
what time is it?
well, you're right.
can you tell time?
you come over here and let me see if you can tell time.
you say that's six o' clock.
what time is it now?
oh, that's three thirty five.
no, that's six thirty.
that's five minutes after five.
no, that's dinner time.
I don't think you can get it in your pocket.
you have to put it back in the bag.
be careful.
yes, it did.
it's a recorder.
recorder.
blowing cars?
what do you mean?
what do you mean?
you can move it anywhere you want.
you can change the shape.
you could wear it for a bracelet.
what?
you better put things in it?
what kind of things would you put in it?
did you show Ursula your car?
a net?
what are you catching?
what kind of fish did you catch?
thank you.
yes, I like fish.
thank you.
what kind of fish is this?
thank you.
thank you.
I think I have enough fish now.
thank you.
well, they have to be clean.
they don't roll?
why not?
why do you think they don't ?
alright.
I'll cook them tonight.
don't put it in there, Adam.
you may forget it.
she has to take them back home.
why don't you put it some place so that you willn't forget it.
what?
some meat?
no thank you.
we're going to have fish.
what else shall we have for supper?
beans?
peas?
and what else?
and macaroni?
anything else?
what would I like from the store?
some soup and some juice.
and some hamburger.
goodbye.
I thought that was the store over near the window.
no?
some macaroni.
thank you.
this is my refrigerator.
right here.
you can look.
Adam, why don't you show Ursula what you did yesterday?
I think it's on the other page on the back.
there.
yes.
I guess not.
yes.
it's a poodle.
it works like a puppet, Adam.
you put your hand in it.
that's right.
you were getting it right.
call somebody back?
oh?
alright.
I don't usually keep soup in my refrigerator.
I keep it in the cabinet.
oh, the shelf right there.
no, the one down here with the bus.
what kind of soup did you buy for me?
oh, thank you.
yes, that was a loud noise.
what was it?
Paul, what?
oh, did Paul say what was it?
no, I said what was it.
not better what?
no, food is better than what?
than hair?
what hair?
no, those are Bandaids.
what do you have on your neck?
absolutely nothing.
I think I need to find your suspenders, don't you think so?
you look like you're about to lose your pants.
how're you going to get it off if I put it on?
which finger?
what did you forget?
is that what he did?
did he ever remember what he forgot?
no thank you.
I don't think I need anything else from the store today.
what do I have to do right now?
what do you have to do?
what're you going to cook for supper tonight?
macaroni and beans.
and fish.
why don't you use the other part of the shelf there for a stove?
no, the other part.
yes.
how do you cook macaroni?
how do you cook it?
my pants is are going to lose.
you mean you're going to lose your pants.
I don't know.
because you wanted me to put it on your finger.
no, just one.
we have to keep those in case we have a real emergency.
you have dirt on your finger?
well, you need to put soap and water on it, not a Bandaid.
no no.
I don't think so.
do you like that?
you don't like it either?
why do you call those sunglasses?
why do you call those sunglasses?
can you?
those are Ursula's glasses.
you do too have glasses.
you have sunglasses that she gave you.
yes.
oh, with the glasses?
why do you think she looks like a raccoon with the glasses on?
around their eyes?
some puppies do.
we saw a puppy in the pet shop that had spots around his eyes.
yes, some puppies don't .
yes.
no, puppies what?
oh, Adam, don't lean on my foot.
no.
well, he's probably played with so much that it's just about to.
Adam.
did you tell Ursula why you call a scarecrow a scarecrow?
that's right.
because my hand is too large to go any further.
no, it's not.
your hand fits in there further than mine.
hello.
what?
you're getting ready to fly?
I'm not keeping you from flying.
an extension cord.
not very far in the air, did it?
yes well, that's far enough because that's not the part that.
where's the other part?
why what?
why does the other part leave?
that's the way a rocket blasts off.
like we say astronaut.
what was his name?
don't do that, please.
then what will I keep my food in?
on the shelf.
well, if I keep butter on the shelf it will melt, will it?
no.
in the bread box.
so, we'll hide it from Daddy and have a surprise?
except you always tell Daddy about the surprises, don't you?
reach what?
oops, you lost something.
let's see, that's part of the motor.
motor.
alright.
well, later perhaps.
I don't have anything to put water in right now.
can you put it back?
oh goodness.
I hope he can swim.
what?
he didn't fall out of the boot.
the boat just tipped over.
I think you can.
a space boat?
what's a space boat?
no, what was that that we watched?
I don't remember.
and where are they going?
oh, what is he doing out in the sailboat anyway?
that's not where they live?
oh, I'm glad.
maybe so.
but I don't think he rides in the boat.
he probably rides in the car.
well, perhaps just to the water's edge.
where?
part of what?
oh, that's the water?
I guess he has to let this down
perhaps he uses his oar to push out from the shore.
where's the oar?
oh, hurry up.
he lost his sail.
do you know why the boat has a sail on it?
what do you think?
why don't you try putting in?
no?
ok.
perhaps the wind blows the boat over.
oh, is that what's happening?
alright.
oh hello.
did you have a ride on your boat today.
oh, his boy went too.
is he going down in there?
I don't know.
because you didn't have it down in there properly I guess.
no no, you don't throw that, Adam.
they're on the bed, Adam.
no no, not at each other.
let's stop throwing them, Adam.
throw over on the bed where no one is sitting.
I may have how many?
what color are yours?
what color is this?
what color is this?
what color is that one in your hand?
what color is the other one?
what color is this?
what color is this?
this is black?
this is yellow.
no, you come over here and throw over there.
see if you can get your spears onto the bed.
why would you throw bugs?
bugs try to get your spear?
you put them in the back and they go what?
no no.
alright.
let's see who can get theirs on the bed.
you have to come back here.
why would you do that?
you missed.
my turn.
Adam wanted to know the other day where the sun went when night
over in your basket.
there's yours over there.
on the dresser.
good.
yours went on the bed.
let's play what again?
I wasn't looking.
what's the matter?
put Ursula's coat back up on the bed, please.
you knocked it down.
no no no.
throw on the bed, Adam.
no no, on the bed.
I threw mine on the bed.
yes, not on the bed, did you?
you did not.
careful, Adam.
Adam.
would you go get that?
let's not throw any more.
because you hurt Paul.
why would you want to do that?
why not?
don't you think it's going to be fun to have a little brother to
why would you want to hurt him?
how can you play with him if he's not in here?
Adam, now don't bother him anymore.
he went way over there to play by himself.
no, Adam.
why do you want to shoot him?
well, he willn't like to play with you if you keep doing things like
I saw, he can walk, yes.
what do you do with those little animals, Adam?
here's one.
where are the other ones?
let's go find Perro.
oh, come on.
what did you do with the animals, Adam?
it clip off?
what kind of bird is that, Adam?
what kind of bird is that?
those are rockets?
why are there so many, Adam?
over by the door?
did you look up on top of the dresser?
I didn't say that, Adam.
that's different.
why're there so many?
that's all.
it willn't stay.
we're playing a little game.
stay on top of the ball game.
just try it and see if you can get the block to stay there.
it's what?
that's a lumber company truck.
Adam, you look so tall.
did you think that?
what are you waiting for, Adam?
Adam, come and let me tie your shoes, please.
I only tied one, please.
everything is what, Adam?
no, I don't think so.
Adam, did you go to school this morning?
did you call to school this week?
yes, you did, Adam Smith.
didn't you go to school yesterday?
tell her where you went this morning.
oh, just today you got new boots.
black shoes?
and what did Paul get?
he curls his feet up so you can't get the shoes on.
Adam, where are you going?
he's learning, isn't he?
oh, Adam, what're all those things over there by your bed?
what kind of toys do you think she must have in the bag?
Adam, take out a few at a time.
oh.
oh, Adam, what is this?
what is this?
what is this?
what is this?
no no no.
you show him how they dance.
I think you broke these off the horse, didn't you?
do you think you can juggle?
oh, what is this, Adam?
a pig!
does a pig have that in back?
what is it?
you saw one on television this morning.
in the water this morning.
no, it wasn't a whale.
seal.
no no, Adam.
no no no no.
what popped out?
I don't think anything did.
a bee might try to get the nectar from the flower, yes.
if it were real but this is a plastic flower.
it's an orchid.
perhaps if it were a real flower a bug might get in there too.
Adam, who is this?
a chatty doll.
which one, Adam?
you could.
I think one did break in Cambridge.
did, was it be a comb.
you could try it that way.
Adam, what is this?
good, Adam.
you paste them together.
you can make a bracelet with paper clips.
there's a horse for the ballerina.
what shall we do?
what do you think you could do with them, Adam?
that's a good idea.
what's a booboo clock?
he has just one baby.
no, he just likes to throw things.
flower.
do you like flowers?
I think you have just one car.
you play over her.
Adam, we forgot to bring that flag home from nursery school.
did you make one?
ballerina?
just like Captain_Kangaroo's ballerina.
that probably is your train?
no, I don't think that's your train.
it's like your train, isn't it?
I don't think you need your train.
you've got that train.
are those Fruit_loops or something like that?
it is?
just put your mouth on there a little.
don't cover the hole.
wasn't there a story about a giraffe who couldn't talk, and he
I was just doing this.
come away, Paul.
no no.
there's a heater over there and it's blowing in his face.
in the hacec?
no, I don't think they say the hacec.
I think they say the face.
I don't know.
yes.
what happened?
like a rocket?
yes.
you what?
no, what does that mean?
yesterday he said something that sounded like Tallahassee.
yesterday he said something that sounded like Tallahassee.
I think he makes up his own newscasts.
what do you say about Tallahassee?
oh, has a hassyc boy.
Adam, what's a hassyc boy.
what's a hassyc?
a genie back.
what's a genie?
what kind of statue?
Paul!
yes, he was.
about Tallahassee.
I don't think she really walks.
oh?
you didn't finish telling Ursula about the American flag that you
it's yours?
why're you going to do that?
Adam, I think Mommy broke the dolly.
broke the leg off.
no, the legs.
yes.
what're you doing, Adam?
no no, you don't bother Ursula's bag.
but you can have a pencil, Adam.
would you like some paper?
say yes please.
she can't hear your head shake.
did I put that in there?
yes.
all set.
why are you so tired?
I was trying to see if she would walk and I broke her legs.
that dolly was made in Italy.
mmhm.
what?
because they make dolls in Italy too and then they ship them to
to be sold in the stores.
no no, Paul Smith.
well, let me get him out of the way, dear.
hmm?
you had an accident.
your train fell off the track.
Jack fell down and broke his crown.
no.
you did a long long time ago.
because you're a little boy and little boys break things.
mmhm, that people bring.
I don't know.
probably why did she take my toys to that little Adam to get
it's what?
careful.
what was it doing?
oh, it's an airplane.
what is that turning?
yes, it may knock Paul.
no no, Paul.
no, he's saying I think that would be nice to eat.
it's a car horn.
it sounds like the horn is stuck.
careful, Adam.
it may pop.
you're going to take the broken doll to the shop on the airplane.
oh, you're not.
and who is he?
well, why did you give him the broken doll?
the what?
the salesman who breaks dolls.
no no, Paul, put it down.
alright.
now come over here with it, Adam.
well, you say tie this, please.
oh, that's nice.
what kind of fish did you catch?
a big fish.
oh, thank you.
what kind of big fish is it?
oh, it's a large one.
that's a small fish.
what kind of fish is that?
oh, a swordfish.
thank you.
did you catch a cowboy on your fishing rod?
oh, what kind of fish is this?
what was that breaking?
is that what it was?
oh, thank you.
what kind of fish is this?
you caught a brush?
oh, goodness.
we have enough fish for supper.
to my children.
yes.
there's a truck stuck.
gently, honey.
you might hurt his head.
you're brushing his hair like a Beatle's hair?
my husband was talking about them last night and he was brushing
Paul reminds me of the cat in Peter and the Wolf wondering if it was
no.
he had a little toy that rolled away from him and he sat there.
the toy that rolls.
down there near your belt.
mmhm.
to eat the bird.
you do?
that's going to pop.
your name.
no, that's al.
this is hl.
yes, that's Hercules.
Hercules begins with an hl.
your name begins with a al.
Paul's name begins with a pl.
al dl al ml.
al.
ml.
no, it seems that something must have been broken.
I don't know what it was part of.
I don't think Robin would have been walking down Washington Street.
you thought you had it.
I don't know who broke it.
no, I didn't break it.
you didn't break it.
it looks like the one that was on our rug that came back from the
this been wrapped on here.
it came from that and some little boy was playing with it on the
and the company man came?
the mailman?
an advertisement?
what're they advertising?
careful careful.
what is that now?
you don't use your fishing rod like that.
thank you.
for catching fish.
the Indians tied him up.
why would you tie the poor Indians up?
why?
because he tied the cowboy up?
they're going to beat him up?
why are they going to do that?
you like Indians that way?
how're you goING To catch those.
they look too tiny to bite.
those are baby fish.
why would you put that in your mouth?
why would you put that in your mouth?
no.
these go on paper that you put in notebooks.
and this keeps the holes from tearing.
that's alright.
you play on this side.
a what?
American what?
American pole?
what?
what're you doing, Adam?
Adam, what're you doing?
if you break the pencil what will you have to write with?
how could you write with it if you break it?
I don't think that would work.
no no, Adam.
don't break the pencil.
she has to do lots of writing and she needs every pencil she has.
no, you don't know what to do with pencils any more.
no, Mommy doesn't let you play with pencils anymore, does she?
why would you do that?
you tell Ursula why you can't play with pencils anymore?
no, I'm talking about the ones you used for writing on the walls.
for you?
would you like a house?
alright.
shall we close the door?
what?
I was talking to your Mother.
Adam, did you go to school this morning?
did you tell her that you ate lunch at school and you came home and
you must have been so hungry, Adam.
what did you have for lunch at school today?
you don't know.
yes.
if I were you?
what?
why does your tummy cry?
Adam, what are you peeking at already?
to eat?
you had two lunches already.
why do you want something to eat?
she has two.
how many do you have?
ten?
she didn't tell you you could look in there.
oh, you're not peeking.
don't you peek then until you ask her.
well, what's the difference in looking and peeking?
did you show Ursula your art gallery?
that's very nice.
did you show her your basket?
where's the hole, Adam?
where's one hole?
oh, you mean one place to put things.
no, not yet.
what are they?
so you can turn the train around in two places.
did you tell Ursula what we did Sunday, Adam?
what else did you do?
you did nothing?
oh, we need to use tracks to put it together.
you have to attach it with train tracks.
the train track's in the box.
what?
it's a support for the track.
what do you think that is?
you could guess.
well, you're close.
but it's something that goes along with the train.
must be a railroad crossing sign.
what did you tell me?
a sponge.
what do you think it's for?
maybe to clean the track.
mmhm.
the other set of wheels must have come off.
perhaps the wheels are down in the box.
what?
two weeks ago there was a little doll that was made in Italy.
oh.
I don't know.
are they two trains or just one train?
the black tracks don't belong to the same set.
because most of the train tracks that are outside are black aren't
they made them this way.
oh, you know how to put that together.
why don't you know how?
what bag, dear?
they have brakes just like cars have brakes for stopping.
you almost stepped on your finger.
a finger toe.
what's a finger toe?
finger people.
what kind of people are those?
oh?
what did you say?
I know you said Italy but what did you say before you said Italy.
injure me or something?
oh, when you used to be in Italy.
oh, when did you go to Italy?
what did you see in Italy?
lions and Italy tigers?
Italian tigers?
are they different from any other tigers?
how are they different?
oh, they're different than those we have here in Boston?
they different them?
what do you mean?
do you know an Italian song?
do you know anything about Italy at all?
what do you know about Italy?
somebody told you about Italy?
could you tell us about Italy, please?
I'd like to know.
come on, let's finish the train.
not yet.
no, she said not yet.
did you tell Ursula what you heard this morning.
a motor boat on the street?
what was a motor boat doing out on the street?
you what?
try to get it back.
I didn't hear a motor boat.
I thought you were putting them together.
yes.
I should think so.
what did you do at nursery school this morning, Adam?
did you go outside at nursery school?
what did you do outside?
you didn't ?
what did you do?
you rode on the Dodge car?
oh, it was a small one?
a small tricycle?
I don't know what a Dodge car is.
oh?
yes.
well, people are born all over the world.
you were born in America.
no.
no, you were born in Boston.
because your mother and father live in Boston.
Italian people, yes.
how do you flash them?
I don't really think they come on or anything.
it doesn't seem to.
I think that's a different train.
don't you think so?
I don't remember what goes first on the train.
what comes first on the train?
what is that?
Adam, you put it under that place where the track goes up, look.
well, it could be that way.
no, turn it around.
on the side.
this way.
it says stop and go.
for the cars that are waiting to cross the track maybe.
well yes, they do.
when there's a train track across a street you have to cross part of
yes.
because they have a factory.
well, sometimes, perhaps there's something wrong with the train or
I don't know.
are you doing it very carefully?
that's right.
I think that doesn't go there.
it's stopped?
no, that's plastic, I think.
here's a piece that isn't broken.
you need some more track.
here's a piece.
put it under the bridge.
it needs another piece of track.
are you too tired?
it's time for what?
I thought you said something about Italy.
oh no.
I didn't say I don't have it.
did I?
later, alright?
let's put this one on.
just the way you put the track on, look.
it's hard.
let's move it over so we have more room.
yes.
you need some more track, don't you?
oh, thank you.
what're you doing, Adam?
what are you using it for, Adam?
they don't fit on that set.
no, but it doesn't fit.
in case you need it.
yes?
a meeting?
I don't hear Paul.
no, that was someone on the street, dear.
talking, I suppose.
oh, Adam, why did you do that?
you're going to put it back on?
how did your hands get so dirty?
no, I don't think that's the wrong way.
if you don't put that down that's part of my bed.
what do you need a rifle for?
why do you want to shoot?
shoot cows?
poor cows.
then what will you do for milk?
how do you know which cows are bad cows?
well, how will you know which ones to fight?
cry them and then you're going to eat them for supper?
your automatic rifle.
no, you can't play with this, this is part of my automatic bed.
no no, Adam, you don't hit anybody with that.
ok?
chopper.
Adam, don't break it, dear.
because it's not yours.
why would you want to pull that anyway?
that must be something new, is it?
automatic bow and arrow?
oh, what is that?
why do you need to flash the light?
why?
why?
lights flash?
said what?
winter stop?
what does that mean?
Koolaid train?
what's the Koolaid song?
what?
you did?
you didn't get hurt, did you?
no.
no no.
here's a turntable you haven't even put on yet.
Adam, do you know why that doesn't fit in there?
it's not round?
you know how to put that in.
it's what?
it's stopped?
well, why don't you try pushing this down.
broken finger.
two dirty fingers, but I don't think they're broken.
dirty dirty fingers.
the sheriff?
no no.
don't do that, Adam.
that's no shovel.
Adam, you're silly.
are you silly?
why don't you go get your cards.
yes, you knocked that down.
put it back up there.
no no, Adam.
you may break that.
put it up on the dresser.
what are you going to do with that?
no more being silly.
that's enough being silly.
Adam, what did the lady say when she told you that story.
story about George Washington.
whoever read that story to you?
did she tell you all of the story or did she just stop with the
did she tell you?
she did?
let's have a race.
have a race?
ok.
mine did too.
mine didn't .
no no, Adam.
your horse is for riding, Adam.
but you chop outside where there are trees.
Adam.
you're trying to do what?
don't break it anymore, dear.
you are?
you cannot?
why not?
I can put it together but it willn't stay without glue.
yes.
what did I do to those?
I put glue on them.
one day we'll get some and make them.
no, they aren't supposed to come off.
we were doing a train track and then you stopped.
yes.
alright.
you put it together.
you put it together and then I'll come and play with you.
why did you do that?
playing the banjo.
no, you play the banjo.
what's the panjoc?
why do you call it the panjoc?
yes.
they're wrong?
why are they wrong?
would you like to do a puzzle?
what puzzle would you like to do?
what puzzle is that?
I don't know what puzzle that is.
you have to look.
no.
Adam.
why do you think that's the wrong place in Italy when you're not
you have to take them apart, Adam.
you have a broken leg.
how did you get a broken leg?
no, Adam, you've got parts of the sign on the floor there.
no no.
there're some more.
here's one.
what do you think it's for?
can't you take them out?
then perhaps you're not big enough to play with those, if those are
you are.
yes, you pull the corners of the plastic, don't you?
want me to show you?
I can't see cowboy hat.
look at that stretching.
stretching.
have you ever seen a stretching man?
you have?
where?
where is a stretching office?
stretching arm.
you don't need to pull this all the way down.
no.
no.
no.
can you think about it?
Mr Owl!
Mr Package?
careful.
no no no.
it's called a tsquare.
does it look like anything you've seen before?
he's working with his father.
he's making something.
no.
look at the things you can make.
what is this?
what kind of house?
you have to have wood.
those are nice, Adam.
perhaps you can get some wood and you can make a bird house.
well, that's not really for trees.
for making small things.
what will I do with that?
you do?
I'll let you use this.
it's called a level.
for being sure that things are straight.
it's a drill.
you can make holes with it.
let me see.
I think I might have something.
see?
see?
what are you making?
why don't you want to cut it?
see?
it really works, doesn't it?
no, you try it.
don't put your fingers down there because it's very sharp.
oh yes, you can.
no, I don't want to do it.
I'm not a little boy.
no, I'm not.
which hand do you use?
a drill.
makes a hole for a screw.
it's a file.
look at the edge and you see something like teeth and when you pull
here's a nail, would you like to try?
be careful you don't hit your hand, Adam.
I'll hold it.
you do it.
want to try it in here?
ouch.
you almost caught me.
why would you hold it with that?
you have to learn.
take your time.
alright.
see?
well, you have to learn how.
if you had a big what?
don't hit my fingers.
you do it.
you do.
you're always turning my beater.
I'll hold it while you turn.
it willn't move.
where's the fish?
oh, I'm watching the fish.
the fish stopped?
why did he stop?
you turn it, dear.
a tsquare for making things straight?
first you mark with a pencil.
I guess they were Cub_Scouts.
cut what?
why?
why?
oh, you can't put it back on once you've cut it off.
well, I can't finish it by myself.
maybe you can drill a hole too.
on this part.
alright.
turn around.
no, not on the floor.
cut what?
yes, that's sharp.
you'll cut your fingers.
no, I'm not going to do it.
did you try marking with this?
no.
I have a blue one.
why don't you write with it first?
I'll hold this while you draw a straight line.
but you have to hold your pencil against there.
oh well, there are lots of things that are hard to do that we have
watch your fingers.
don't cut your thumb, Adam.
oh no, you cut it.
well, then perhaps you're not big enough to play with the tools.
oh, you're going to cut yourself.
you haven't cut yourself yet.
are you sure?
you've got to be careful now.
hmm?
a wrench?
screw it.
no.
that's right.
that's the way you screw.
now how can you unscrew it?
if you had to unscrew how would you do it?
you hurt yourself.
you could drill a hole through that.
I'll hold it and you turn, I've seen carpenters do that, have you?
sometimes I watch them build houses and make furniture.
use your hammer and take it out.
now you can drill right through there.
you can screw that on.
where's your screwdriver?
mmhm.
did you look behind you?
very good.
why did you knock it?
did you try cutting that?
you could turn it over and cut a door in it.
you're sleepy, aren't you?
are you going to take a nap tomorrow?
yes.
watch your fingers, Adam.
pull it back and forth.
what?
ok.
no, dear.
I can't use that while you're there.
turn that.
how can it be an old hole when you just made it?
that has to be a new hole.
what do you need to open it for?
there.
what are you going to put in there anyway?
what would you want to put?
that's right.
you can't .
why not?
are you getting a runny nose?
can you pull it out now?
that's a level.
to see if something is straight.
some water.
where's your saw?
you can make a door that opens.
can I take a message?
can you cut along here, Adam?
shall we do it together?
that's it.
there's a door.
you did?
a car?
is that a garage?
I think you have a car up there on the shelf that might just fit in.
on the top shelf.
on the other side.
maybe Paul took it.
you what?
yes?
I don't think he really has it because he's upstairs sleeping.
here are two little cars.
one named Joe?
and what's the other one's name?
what was that you were doing Adam?
two little birdies?
how does that go?
what are two little birdies?
oh, thank you.
thank you.
the magnet?
no, I didn't .
I looked for it at home too.
it must be lost someplace.
I have as many toys in my house as you have in yours.
a lot of toys, yes.
be careful that you don't cut your fingers with that.
a what?
how can that be a key?
Christmas what?
in June?
here's al.
no.
no, your name is al.
Arnold.
begins with al.
well, that's not really big enough for a tree.
the pencil came apart because it is small, but a tree is big.
oh?
what birdies would live in a tree with a hole in it?
Paul woke up last night and was just playing in his bed.
you can't ?
look what's happening.
it's changing color, isn't it?
just what's on the paper is changing color.
green.
you take another color.
I'll change.
you take this.
you eat yourself up?
why would you want to do that?
it's true.
you can eat yourself if you want to.
I just don't know why.
I should think that's hard.
you're going to eat yourself up?
why are you going to do that?
you can?
you're telling jokes on yourself?
that's what I thought.
Adam, are you still sleepy?
you're just yawning.
what made you get up so early?
I'm just putting some things away.
so we'll have some space for walking.
in your refrigerator?
where's your refrigerator?
did you go to school this morning?
you didn't have a cold.
you had a sore throat.
his tonsils were enlarged.
where are they, Adam?
when the hammer knocked you down.
what hammer?
yes.
in the toy box?
you're a toy?
oh, you're not a toy?
all about what?
I was going to put this together.
you have to screw it.
I think perhaps it's the wrong way.
I think perhaps that's the right way.
no.
a bench.
what do you think?
mmhm.
perhaps there's a tiny one to go in the tiny hole.
it's a ruler.
I don't know.
how did what?
I don't know.
he fell down?
why don't you turn it over?
I'll hold this.
there it is.
oh, you lost something.
careful, so you don't hit your hand.
hold it straight.
what do you want, Adam?
that's what I thought.
I don't think so.
I don't quite know how that fits on there.
what is it?
I think perhaps something is missing.
I think she's right.
what's missing?
I don't know what you'd call that.
do you see the pilot?
what do you think it is?
let's try to figure it out.
what does he need if he jumps out?
what is it saying?
that's one of the wheels.
did you remember what this is on his back?
you've got one.
and when you throw it up in the air what happens?
I don't know where you put it.
Adam, when it opens it looks like this.
yes.
now it's all folded up.
does the other pilot have one too?
would you like to look at a book?
I have an al bl cl book.
ok.
maybe we can read it together.
look, what is that?
this must be the letter al.
what is that?
ant.
acorn.
what is this?
look at that.
it's another ant.
and that's
Captain Bob has one of these.
do you remember what it is?
anchor.
and this is what letter?
bl.
these sounds all sound like bl.
like what?
and this is the letter.
that's not bl, that's
cl.
and this is
no.
and what is this?
you're taking yourself to the hospital?
I don't think you've ever seen that before.
it's cactus.
this is dl.
it's most of the animals?
what is this?
ducks.
a bear?
oh, I've never seen a bear that looked like that.
oh, you said doggie.
what is this?
what are these?
if this is a drum and you have these with the drum what do you call
take a guess.
no, what would you call those?
if you have a drum and you play the drum with these what would you
that's pretty good.
drum sticks.
and what are these?
these are dragon flies.
those are dragon flies.
that's a donkey.
this is the letter el.
and what are these?
these are tusks tusks.
no.
what is this?
no.
that's an eggplant.
we'll see one next time we go the grocery store.

mmhm.
oh, you're a snake?
you're all wound up like a snake too.

if he's not a snapping turtle.

the part that comes out of the blower.
yes, it disappeared.
well, it takes practice.
what happens when you laugh?
blow.
blow again.
what?
is this what you said you wanted to make?
careful, you'll put a hole in it.
there's a little left.
that would make a nice hat.
I'll make one if you like.
for cooking?
eat this?
it's alright.
there's one over there behind you.
it's stuck on your pants.
a snow man.
but this is stuck.
let's try one of these.
shall I tie it?
no, she doesn't want to blow that.
she blew one up.
it's a sailboat?
I don't know.
what do you think it's for?
well, close your eyes and try it.
look at that.
it's a little hard.
you can't do that.
I have a little printing set.
yes, you can take them apart.
I have a little printing set.
yes, you can take them apart.
you're trying to do what?
it's the ink pad.
you can't ?
just leave that in, Adam.
may I try it once?
be very careful with this one.
turn it over and press it down.

there's ink on the pad and you press the ink on the paper.

no?
she's a little girl.
you didn't do very many.
ok.
maybe it ran away.
where is the al?
is this it?
what?
doubly doubly with gum.
I think there's an advertisement that says.
double your pleasure.
oh, that's it.
you saw that on tv.
there's a dot that says cross your printing set?
oh, Adam, what is this?
you only did one side.
there's one over there.
what is this the top to?
is that the top or is that the bottom?
where's the bottom?
no.
your what?
your finger print?
where?
yes, we did.
I see it.
I see two.

Bambi?
no, that's part of Hercules' name.
you're the doggie who ran away?

hold it up toward the light.
I don't know.
what is it?
put it on the chair.
hold it up toward the light.
a may fly.
put it on the chair, honey.
what do you think it is?
it's a stone fly.
what made you think that was a joke?
is that really what that is, Adam?
yes.
what do you think it is?
what does it look like?
what is it?
maybe it's the same dragonfly.
what does it look like?
is that what I look like?
a giant water bug?
let's see, Adam, what the next one is.
you tell me what they look like and I'll tell you what they are.
what's that?
hold it toward the light.
stone fly.
whoever saw a stone fly?
you did?
how did you see a stone fly?
is that a dragon fly?
I think you have that wrong.
can you be a dragonfly?
careful with your dirty fingers.
they are blue, yes.
no, they are blue.
they have blue ink on them.
it's probably your finger.
what do you think it is?
this is a fish fly.
I never saw a fish fly.
I think you have it in the wrong way.
that's a giant water bug.
it's a water scorpion.
right there.
just turn toward the light.
this must be a new one.
what is it?
my brother got those.
what's your brother's name?
what's your brother's name?
Adam, don't you have a brother?
I thought so.
what's his name?
what's your sister's name?
Cora Lee?
that's my sister.
your girl?
you don't have a girl.
don't put your fingers here.
yes, I think I got it from you.
that's a may fly.
that's a finger.
a finger print?
that's a water bug.
yes, I suppose so.
it's almost like a stone fly.
what is so dangerous?
that's a giant water bug.
you're trying to get it in?
keep trying.
just takes a little practice.
shall we put them back?
alright.
did you go shopping?
what did you get?
you dropped all the slides.
does he talk?
I don't know that he talks.
I don't think he talks, does he?
his feet?
you march with it.
what does that look like?
what do you think?
what do you think that is?
did you tell Ursula what the doctor found in your ears the other
the Doctor found some birdies.
hello, Adam.
hello, Adam.
hmm?
hello said the bird.
hello said the bunny.
would you like to keep the birdie?
alright.
those are some pictures.
why don't you take two?
how many do you have?
she said two.
one.
put the others back.
you've given up on Mommy blowing.
I'm afraid I can't blow them up.
I guess I put all the air in Bobof when I blew him up yesterday.
you have?
how do you know it's big air?
you really caught it.
I tried very hard.
no, I didn't break my mouth.
oh.
two arms?
thank you for what?
a bottle?
a bottle of what?

no.
what color are these?
what color is this?
this is orange.
that is red.
one red and two orange.

you don't need another.
why don't you sing that song for Ursula?

sing it for Ursula?
it's a rattlesnake?
I don't know.
what is that in your shoe?
is it going to bite?
it was an animal.
what kind of animal?
hmm?
it must have come from another one.
where's my farmyard truck?
I guess not.
you what?
you went out at nursery school.
what did you play outside?
you played Daddy?
Daddy Adam?
you played cowboy?
some visitors are coming at my house?
why?
why?
in my back?
in your bag?
in what bag?
you almost did.
I see something up here.
do you see anything on here?
I thought perhaps if you looked you could tell me.
I see something.
mmhm.
what kind of bird is it?
what do you mean on my bone leg?
how can you throw snowballs.
there's no snow.
no no no.
let's not throw things.
why do you say that?
they don't feel like snow.
I'm not.
it is not snow.
how does snow feel?
how does snow feel?
did you tell Ursula what movie you saw Saturday?
you were telling me about a movie that you saw.
airplane movie?
I thought you said it was about somebody fighting something.
some kind of fighter.
remember?
somebody had a red
oh, a bull fighter.
you don't fight the bull like that, do you?
you have a little cape?
we'll take you out another day.
ok.
you're supposed to move.
or else the bull will knock you down.
ok.
why don't you try to throw an animal in the bag?
good.
don't stand so close.
pick the animals up and throw them in.
good.
good.
good.
good.
you missed.
you're a silly.
do you know that?
why would you do that?
oh, poor mummy.
no.
oh, I don't want to shoot you.
no, I don't like shooting.
throw that at you?
ok.
I'll throw that at you.
what's the matter?
why did you ask me to do that?
you want to play?
ok.
what do you want to play?
I'm not playing Indian.
why don't you ask Ursula where she got this?
no.
no.
Ursula is Ursula.
Adam is Adam?
spear is spear?
you didn't ask her about those.
I think she has an interesting story to tell about those.
you did?
you must have a big tummy ache.
if you ate all of those animals certainly you must have a big
I don't want to eat my animals.
but I don't want any animals.
but I don't want any animals.
no, you missed my mouth anyway.
no.
where does that go?
which hand?
which hand?
that hand?
the other hand.
what's the matter with your finger, Adam?
but doesn't it hurt, Adam?
why?
don't mash your finger, Adam.
it will hurt you.
why does your finger hurt?
you had it in your mouth so much?
oh, I'm sorry.
you did?
you did?
how do you play baseball?
oh, you swing the bat.
and what do you do?
and someone has a glove.
and what else?
why do you swing the bat?
oh, you play golf too?
how do you play golf?
neither have I.
she didn't say that.
OH, what is that you have in your hand?
why don't you show Ursula your puppets?
what kind of puppets are they?
what is she doing?
I don't think they want to fight.
I think they're friends.
they're kissing.
how did you hurt your finger?
scratched it on something?
why don't you tell Ursula about the television program you saw?
a fish.
a fish fell down!
oh, you're not a fish.
no.
a finger fish.
I've seen a whale.
in a book.
I don't know where the book is now.
why did it do that?
it's a patrol car.
I think it's just skinned a little.
scraped.
perhaps you hit it against something and some of the skin came off.
what do you think?
why don't you get it and see what it does?
what's the matter?
it looks like a friendly animal.
what do you think it is?
you didn't play much with it.
look how nice and soft it is.
you don't .
why don't we name it something.
no, you tell me what it is.
it's something you've seen.
is it as tall as a giraffe?
what is the music it's playing?
oh, tell me why you're frightened.
there.
isn't it nice and soft?
why don't you get your book and see if you see anything that looks
huh?
it can't really walk.
let's look in the book.
you don't have what?
those are fish.
do you think so?
look at it carefully.
look at it carefully.
ask Ursula if that's , it is.
yes.
some people eat snails, yes.
because they like them.
no, I don't think I'd like to eat snails.
because it's the custom in their country to eat snails.
is he friendly?
that's what?
oh, that's church music?
what's the name of the song?
does it?
it's a bug.
mmhm.
what?
I'm not sure that it does anything with the bee.
do they have beginning sounds that are alike?
what about bird?
no.
I don't know what kind they are.
it's a pretty color, isn't it?
nothing.
it just plays nice music.
oh, you do?
you'll have to talk to Ursula about that.
what shall we do?
alright.
look at it carefully.
perhaps you can find out.
I think it would be much more fun if you find out.
you look very carefully.
ok, I'm looking too.
I don't know if it's that way.
what is this?
a house?
what kind of a house?
I was just putting them on there.
you tell me what sound they make as you pick them up.
and what?
oh, you turned into a flower pot too.
that's not white, that's brown, isn't it?
you were right at first.
white.
brown and white.
because they were painted that way or made that color.
in the factory?
oh, we we have a factory?
where?
what do we make in our factory?
oh, what is that?
what is that?
look at it carefully.
it says gobble gobble gobble.
did you?
because it is a
turkey.
can you?
yes.
yes.
you buy them from the grocery store.
there're so many.
will you fit?
what did?
what ate all the farm animals up?
it's a what?
do what?
what do you mean?
is that a dance he's doing?
ok, he's all put together.
what is that?
they just left this.
when they were cutting the animal out.
they didn't take this off.
it's the same kind of thing, isn't ?
that's just something extra.
I don't know.
you'll have to ask Ursula.
I think you could.
she can't see it.
mmhm.
yes, probably he'll put them in his mouth.
because he likes to put things in his mouth.
alright.
how shall we do it?
do you have something for fences, Adam?
your fences.
I was walking, rocking on your leg.
oh, I'm so sorry.
what melted?
is that how it goes?
they don't go together do they, Adam?
a fence.
alright.
you make part of it too.
is that where you want the door to be?
alright.
let that be the door.
there's one behind it.
oh, did they?
alright.
the lamb's Mother?
did you look behind you?
is that a baby lamb?
no, I think it's really a dog.
oh, you opened it, didn't you?
yes, because they're frightened of the big tractor.
because it's so big.
Mr farmer, don't you have a small tractor?
do you have a tractor that's smaller than that one?
you mean in here?
alright.
mmhm.
yes.
not on the farm when the animals are out.
because it might run over some of the animals.
it might hurt the animals because the tractor's so big.
the rest of what?
oh, there's food for the animals.
what is it?
oh, each one gets it and each one eats it?
what is it?
yes.
sometimes they catch them and eat them.
hmm?
Adam, I hear something over here talking in your farm yard.
quack quack quack quack quack.
what was that?
I don't know.
quack quack quack quack quack quack.
quack quack quack quack quack quack.
it stopped.
I hear something saying gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble.
gobble gobble gobble gobble.
no, I don't hear that saying gobble gobble gobble gobble.
what says gobble gobble?
hiss hiss hiss.
what does that say?

why do you need a camera?
you do have a camera.
you don't have a what?
ok.
ok.
now you'll have to pick them up.
oh, we're going to take turns.
I put them up last time.
you put them up.
yes, but we have to take turns.
it looks like they're dancing around in a circle.
will you have room for the animals?
no.
some are hatching what?
is that what a rooster does?
he crows, but when he crows what does he say?
cock_a_doodle_doo.
no, you have too much in there and it's not in there properly.
no.
I don't know.
why do you think they they have windows?
take a guess.
why do you have windows in your house?
so that the animals can see out and can have air in the barn.
those are windows aren't they?
why should there be men in there?
what's that?
you bowl.
they're already up.
no, you said we would put them up together.
alright.
I've put some up.
how many did you knock down?
two?
you knocked down as many as I did.
are they the same?
well, who knocked more down?
did I knock down more than you did or did you knock more down than
no, this is mine.
yours went under the play pen.
I'll put yours up and you put mine up.
you dropped them.
I don't know why.

but what's his name?
remember the story about Lassie
don't break it, dear.
in there?
they're all out in the field.
you don't know what a field is?
don't do that.
that's just the way it was made.
don't do that.
you may break him.
he doesn't move.
what can you see in dark woods?
I don't know.
do you?
what blind man?
please, don't eat me up.
ow ow.
let's play eat?
what kind of game is that?
cluck cluck cluck cluck.
just push down on this when you want to change the picture.

what do you think that is?
tell me what you see.
take your finger off, Adam.
your finger couldn't get in there.
what do you see?
a fence, yes, and what else?
that's the story of Cinderella.

a king?
Cinderella bringing the pumpkin to the godmother.
do you see the pumpkin?
something was blowing around?
what was that?
that's your finger.
perhaps you'd like to look at another one.
would you?
there are a few stories and lots of cities.
any particular city you'd like to see?
which one?
city or state?
can you think of one you'd like to see?

that's Jack exchanging the cow for a pig.
and Jack trades the pig for a bean.
that's part of the machine.
that's Jack's house.
why it's dark?
it's not dark.
perhaps it's early in the morning and the sun is only on one side of

you wouldn't like to see this one?
alright.
do you see anything?
ow?
these are nice, Adam.
let's look at this one.
this is about Holland Michigan.
there are some flowers here that you've seen before.
see if you can tell me what kind they are.
are they all the same color?
you think so?
yes.
the ones in front are the same color.
aren't they pretty?
yes, they are tulips.
here's something I think you'll like, Adam.
I think you'll like that.
alright.
you got it in.
how does that work, Adam?
alright.
that's nice.
can you put it back together?
I don't know if I know how.
which goes on top?
she does?
oh, Paul.
isn't that dirty?
Adam, do you remember what I told you I saw at the museum?
why don't you tell Ursula about it?
what is a squirmc?
what is a squirmc worm?
oh, that's a nice hat.
I don't suppose I've seen anyone else with a hat on like that.
oh, that's a church hat?
why is that a church hat?
well, this is the top one.
here's the other one.
can't you turn it?
there it is.
where are your marbles?
there's one over these.
no no no.
where's the other one?
what is an earache?
those are the guys?
this is mine.
where's yours?
oh?
this is a fix if you want yours in a particular place.
oh no, I don't have any more cranberry juice.
that was the last cranberry juice.
I didn't buy any cranberries, I bought some strawberries.
yes.
that's enough.
no, we're going to have those for supper.
wait, I don't feel like boxing.
you're going to beat me all up?
yep.
close the door, Adam.
oh, thank you very much.
what is this?
what is this?
what is this?
no, that's dl.
what is this?
whoops.
excuse me.
you alright?
I didn't do that.
I was holding the cart and you hit your face on the cart.
because I was afraid you were hurt.
you're a dinosaur?
well, what are you?
can you learn the cards first?
you put them in separate groups on the floor.
what is this?
what is this?
yes, how did you know?
the tagalong man.
who is that?
where does the al go?
what is that?
no, dl.
here's another one.
it sounds like you're scratching your floor.
you wouldn't scratch your floor, would you?
what do you mean the top floor?
remember, Paul's a dinosaur.
all the other animals are afraid of a dinosaur because he's so big.
oh, you're a dinosaur too.
you're the big brother dinosaur.
I don't know why.
Adam, you didn't go to school this morning.
we didn't realize it but the school was closed because of the
no, not today.
no, not today.
can you ride it, Adam?
what're you doing?
Paul is thirteen months.
whyn't cha sing the song you heard last night?
about the cowboy?
cowboy who needs a hat.
yes.
well, he was dreaming.
he didn't wake up but that was the dream.
in the dream he was the cowboy.
is that a song on a record?
we saw it on Walt_Disney.
but you say it?
what happened?
did the horse hurt you?
Adam, did you have a dream last night?
you didn't ?
no.
no, I don't think so.
I'm afraid the horse may get hurt driving into a truck.
why do you say he has wheels?
I don't know.
what color are his eyes.
do you know?
I don't think it really turns, does it?
well, how would you turn it?
careful.
mmhm.
you ran over a bean bag.
are you in a rodeo?
your horse threw you off?
careful.
you have to watch out for Paul's fingers.
you didn't ?
watch Paul.
yes, you almost ran over me.
in your garage?
what are you going to put in your garage?
you wouldn't put your horse there, would you?
horses should have a barn.
does it close?
let me see.
want some sugar, horse?
here, horsie.
oh?
here, Paul, give the horsie some sugar.
hi, Adam.
that's no mixer.
Adam, let Paul try this.
stop crying, Paul.
why are you doing that?
where is the pie?
that must be a special kind of horse.
what kind of horse is this?
a wheelbarrow horse.
would you find that horse in a special place?
but you made him?
does he have a name?
does he have a name?
what's his name?
what?
Gil?
watch those fingers.
did you get stepped on?
that was just an accident he said.
what is the horse killing?
why?
oh, what is it you're killing?
no.
yes, but what is it supposed to be?
to kill the noise?
you mean stop the noise.
because that's the way it's made.
that's a saddle, isn't it?
I guess.
how do they do what?
you put your foot like the policeman we saw.
well, I don't ride in it because I'm too big.
there's a make-believe place right there where you put your foot.
sit in the saddle, and your feet to right there.
what did you say?
no no.
yes, if there's nothing in your way.
mmhm.
I don't know really.
where're you going?
what?
ok.
don't have an accident now.
you did?
very good.
you going to let the horse rest for a little?
don't pull the microphone any more.
that was the bean bag and the boat too.
the boat was back there.
no no, dirty.
alright.
can you say ball?
oh, it's not?
ok.
what?
I'm going to someone's house now?
alright.
whose house?
oh, we haven't got there?
but we're landing down to get some more people.
ok.
hello.
ok.
I'm out.
I'm out.
get back in the airplane?
no no, Paul.
Adam is playing with the airplane.
oh, why is it doing that?
oh, that's not an accident.
how does an airplane come down?
does it come straight down?
he drives?
why does he do that?
drive.
because it doesn't have a motor.
I don't really know where a motor is on an airplane.
why don't you ask Ursula.
perhaps she knows.
this is the landing wheel.
after you get up in the air it folds back.
because it has a motor and it has a pilot to drive it.
I guess it's misplaced.
it must be lost.
no, in Robin's home.
what doesn't move?
what's the matter, Paulie?
oh no, I don't think you should throw it.
oh no, I don't think you're supposed to do that.
it's not a real airplane.
why do I put my hand on it?
I don't know.
it's just not in here.
it's just lost.
then wind it up again.
why can't you?
how can a what?
get an airplane when it's up in the sky?
well, it can't because a bulldozer doesn't what?
what does an airplane do?
well, does a bulldozer?
why?
you know.
a bulldozer doesn't fly.
it doesn't have any wings.
Adam, why don't you want to do this yourself?
no, don't do that.
you may break it and it's Paul's .
I don't know.
it's going to do what?
you're not?
well, I don't think a horse can fly.
I don't suppose he can catch it.
yes, perhaps he can if he can run that fast.
another what?
that would be very funny, Adam.
why don't you stand back a little further?
I'll have the green one.
thank you.
alright.
I missed.
you throw it.
you throw first.
that's green.
no, I have two and you have two.
but if you take one of mine how many will you have?
now, how many do you have?
five!
count them.
how many do you have?
you have how many?
count them.
one two three.
will you throw?
he doesn't want to throw.
I'll throw it for him.
thank you.
what?
somebody missed?
Paul has what?
if Paul gets one how can you have four if there are only four?
oh, you didn't say which one.
thank you, Adam.
you what?
you didn't miss.
why did you have to do that?
it doesn't matter how they fall, does it, as long as they're on?
is this my birthday?
what kind of cake is it?
icecream cake.
how old is Mommy?
oh, you're six and I'm seven.
what are you shooting or are you just cooking?
what kind of gun is that?
is that a new style gun?
a bullet gun?
what does a bullet gun do?
alright.
will you give me a slice?
thank you very much.
that's your slice, isn't it?
oh, Adam, you're a very good cook.
well, what is that?
what is that?
they're so many you're afraid they're going to fall off?
what happened?
oh, thank you.
that's very good.
what do you call that?
icecream dessert?
what's too big?
what?
you smell me?
how do I smell?
difficult.
no, I don't .
what does difficult smell like?
you didn't tell Ursula yet what Mommy burned.
that's the strange odor you smelled.
I'll tie your shoes.
are you a dancer, Adam?
what?
what do you have on your shoulder?
colors put on?
those are what cowboys put on.
what is it?
but the cow?
oh, is that the rope?
I don't like shooting.
didn't one go in your garage?
what other one?
how many did you have?
how many do you have?
count them again.
so, how many are you missing?
how can you be missing two if you have four now.
didn't you count four?
you certainly do talk a lot.
you need six?
you do.
they're really having a vacation.
you're going to have one, aren't you?
what is it?
tell me what it is.
oh, it's a cave.
yes, they're nice.
thank you.
does this have a name?
where's the name?
would you like to cut them?
you'd like to cut them.
I'll get some scissors.
alright.
are you tired?
what?
did you ask Ursula if it's alright to cut?
oh yes.
what is this?
how can I wear it?
it doesn't stay.
what is that?
a worm.
not in your mouth.
Paul.
who?
what kind of trouble, Adam?
what people?
thank you.
here are my cuttings?
they're not right?
what's wrong with them?
well, then they must be right.
why're you getting tired of cutting?
you need some what?
razors.
what do you use razors for?
what is that for?
this is shaving cream.
yes, Paul wants to shave.
do you have a razor blade, Adam?
one side is alright.
I don't see a mirror there.
a mirror.
for you to look in while you shave?
what are those?
razor blades.
it doesn't seem to stay very well.
oh, anyway you want to.
I think it'd be better if you took your hat off.
what does Daddy do?
doesn't he put it on his face?
where does a beard grow?
you look funny.
oh, you've finished shaving?
here, Paul.
Paul.
wait till it stops.
you're going to shave again?
you like to shave.
don't put it in your mouth.
ok.
why don't you go get one of Paul's diapers?
oh my goodness.
you don't give your beard time to grow.
you've finished shaving.
oh, I don't think so.
no.
ladies don't have to shave.
boys when they're almost men, not little boys like you.
David doesn't shave yet.
I don't feel anything there.
why're you going to shave again?
are you going to shave again?
because what?
what happens?
can you see what you're doing?
I think you are sitting on the razor.
he's been trying this for the past several days.
I guess you must be the only man who shaves with a diaper around.
oh, do you know anybody else who might do that?
your Daddy?
you always need something to wipe you off.
you never heard of what?
what?
a red blown chest?
what is that?
a red red blown chest?
what is it?
your Daddy will what?
will surprise?
will surprise that you shave?
when you finish you must put the top because Paul will spill it.
you what?
red ball shoes?
what is a chess?
red ball chess?
what is a chess?
what is a chest?
is it a pair of shoes, is it a shirt, is it a box?
a pair of shoes?
some what?
some blood on you?
why?
when you were shaving?
what happened?
why do you have blood on you?
a cold is blood?
how is that?
a lion.
oh, you can?
how can you?
oh, with your gun?
goodness, you must have used it all.
I guess so.
mmhm.
what is it?
blood?
what is blood?
perhaps.
doesn't that hurt?
your beard is goING To grow?
some what?
some more what?
you're silly.
did you learn that song at home?
what do you see on the tv when they sing that?
don't they show a picture perhaps of a little boy or a little
what're they doing?
you don't what?
do you see that on Captain Kangaroo?
look what you put on the floor?
let Paul have one, honey.
where're you going?
he willn't hurt it.
let him play with some.
you did what?
one of my what?
it wouldn't ?
there's one over there.
he looks like one of George Washington's troops.
one of the members of George Washington's army.
I think we just need one more under here.
it's your hat, Paul.
no, I don't want to.
let Paul wear it.
I don't want to.
why don't we let Paul wear it if you don't want to.
who is George Washington?
nightnight, Adam.
no, don't wipe it off.
you missed it.
use the diaper.
I don't know.
what do you need?
so that the razor will cut the beard.
as long as the blade stays in don't you think that's alright?
but it doesn't stay in.
it doesn't fit properly.
see?
you lost your blade.
mmhm.
now wipe the blade.
you're sitting on some.
wipe the blade.
don't rub it in too much.
then you can't see any.
well, if you wish.
do you want to shave my hand?
you shave with the razor, don't you?
why do you call it cream?
yes, that's cream.
I see.
well, you shave it off.
oh, you're supposed to shave it off.
I'm waiting for you to shave it off my hand.
why're you going to do that?
I did not.
I didn't tell you to use all that.
did I, Paul?
shame on you, Paul.
it ran under the railroad track.
how did it get under there?
no, you shaved those one once.
that you're making?
whose birthday is it?
is it Ursula's too?
no, when is hers?
oh, hers is in July.
under where?
under there?
no thank you.
huh?
yes, that's a track.
what are you doing?
no.
that's for shaving.
it's not for eating.
the cream that you put on there.
you used it all.
why?
why do you need cream?
how could you hold it?
you don't mean razor blades.
you mean a razor?
that what?
oh, that's an electric shaver.
I don't know.
that's an electric shaver.
yes, I think so.
no, I don't think so.
Adam, you look like you're breaking out with something.
on your forehead.
across your nose.
let Ursula look at you.
I don't know.
what does breaking up mean?
go, let Ursula look at it.
you tell her to look right there.
please, don't .
I'm no clown.
I like to eat my pie, not have it thrown in my face.
please, don't .
but we're not clowns in a circus.
we're in a house, but I don't think we're having a circus.
Adam.
no!
yes, you did.
Adam, Mommy saw you hit Paul right in the face.
now don't do that again.
no.
I'll have to spank you right in front of Ursula.
why?
because I spank you when you're naughty?
you had a string in your hair.
I was giving it to you.
no, you have a piece of string.
Adam, do you see anything in the room that sounds like toy?
what has a beginning sound like toy?
no.
well yes, a ball is a toy.
but what has a beginning sound like toy?
train, yes.
that rhymes with it.
train.
house?
a toy house.
anything else?
what?
can you think of anything else that has a beginning sound like toy?
can you say toy?
what about?
yes, truck.
you went to North_Carolina?
where did you stay?
were you on a farm, Adam?
how did you go to North_Carolina?
did you go on the train or come back on the train?
how did you get there, Adam?
your tummy is full.
what did you have for lunch today at nursery school?
pineapple and what else?
pineapple for dessert?
and what else did you have?
what is that?
a bow?
rock you?
did you see any Indians in North_Carolina?
no?
what did you see in North_Carolina?
did you see any cows?
you did so.
and saw the cows being milked?
were men milking them or machines, Adam?
that's a squeaky scooter.
whose scooter do you suppose that is?
it must be Robin's .
is that the way you ride a scooter?
I don't know.
I don't know how to ride a scooter.
you have to go talk to Ursula.
no, I don't think so.
yes, I think so.
because you were laughing.
you weren't laughing?
I see somebody's name, Adam on the.
scooter.
rl ol bl il nl.
whose name is that?
yes, that's Robin.
no, he didn't go to sleep when you did.
you were sleeping before he went to sleep.
what're you doing?
no, you push yourself with this foot.
keep that foot on there.
what did you do at nursery school this morning?
why do you think that's called a scooter?
I asked you first.
I don't know either.
yes, possibly.
yes, when it goes fast.
I don't know which is better for you.
now push yourself with this foot.
that's right.
you change feet so you can back up?
it takes practice to learn to ride, doesn't it?
that's right.
yes, it only has one.
why would you put two wheels there?
will you see what?
no, I just picked it up.
so that you would not break it.
this is the bow.
you need what to go on it?
an arrow.
not today I don't .
what happened on the train?
what did you do on the train?
we were sitting in chairs and we went out.
when we came back they were beds.
maybe I have something for an arrow.
one of the tinker toys.
alright.
well, pick them up.
well, go get it.
I don't think it's quite long enough to go much further.
it willn't go very far.
hmm?
it doesn't have an arrow.
Robin has some arrows at home.
next time?
maybe if she wants to.
yes, I could bring them next time.
you what?
this is last night day.
you're going to wheelbarrow?
I don't know exactly what he's saying but yesterday we made him a
whoops, you had an accident.
a dozen of eggs.
that you eat?
is that a song?
a dozen of eggs song?
where did you learn that?
did you learn another one today?
what was it?
that's another joke?
Robin had a white mouse.
a real one.
one that crawls around.
a mouse.
Robin has a little cage for the mouse.
yes, a little cage for the mouse.
because he's easier to take care of that way.
no, he sleeps in the daytime and wakes up at night.
mmhm.
animals don't wake up?
what animals wake up in the morning time?
I thought owls sleep in the daytime.
oh?
I don't think so.
what is it now, Adam?
oh, it's cutting grass.
hmm?
what is it now?
I don't know.
what is it?
your bike is wobbly too, isn't it?
careful, Adam, you don't want it to break it.
this is what?
Adam, what is that supposed to be?
you aren't supposed to turn that.
it's not balanced like that.
I'm afraid you're going to break it.
when does it fall?
watch it this time and see when it falls.
why don't you come back a little?
see, it's still up.
see, it's still up.
but it's falling.
now why is it falling?
when you turn the corner what happens?
when you try to turn what happens?
do you know why it falls?
go backwards and see what happens.
why don't you back out?
it doesn't fall off when you go in a straight line.
when you turn the corner then it falls.
what is it supposed to be?
well, why don't you ride it?
show Paul how to ride the scooter.
oh no, you ride it and show him how to ride it.
don't want to show him.
tell Ursula about the story you read.
Hop_on_Pop.
I'll get you some water.
Adam, maybe your fire engine will stay on better.
I don't think that's ever going to stay on.
you know what you might do, Adam?
and what else?
did you tell her that you visited a dairy?
maybe you could tie it on.
do you want to tie it?
need some help?
you will hold it?
no, Paul, no no.
he wants his car, honey.
he was playing with this one.
you didn't have any car.
would you like a drink of water?
I'm sure we can find a car in here.
you hit his finger.
no, you didn't .
I think you hit his finger.
don't do that anymore.
yes.
I don't think so.
he's giving you the other one.
he didn't really knock it down.
because the knots came out.
because the knots in the string came out.
I tied some knots in the string and they came out.
why are you tying it?
no, I don't really think so.
wait.
don't run over Paul.
block.
there are lots of blocks in the basket.
did you find some?
I didn't think you'd notice.
yes, if you'd like to play blocks.
blocks?
alright.
oh no, those are his.
you have to go get some from the basket.
go fill this box with blocks.
it doesn't need to have a top.
because you'll be careful.
you willn't throw them out, will you?
you will so.
I don't think it has a top.
oh, what is that?
oh, what letter is that?
I think not.
see?
it almost shot the wall.
did you tell Ursula about the elephants walking down the street?
was somebody riding on the elephant, Adam?
and what else?
where were they going?
yes, they were going to get on their train.
it took Robin a long time, Adam.
you can't just use one hand.
you have to use two.
there.
see.
oh, that's an animal?
what kind of animal?
an elephant in a train.
what does the elephant do in a circus?
the elephant what?
you know how to do it?
no, you hold this.
oh, you've learned how to do it.
oh, you're a big boy now.
you stand up with some legs.
what did you say?
he didn't sleep well last night.
I think he's getting some molars.
molars.
back teeth.
yes, that's right.
let it rest on your head like that.
no, I don't think I'd like to.
willn't you please go get it?
alright.
I'm sorry.
I was just happy because you were doing such a good job.
do you want to tell Ursula about the museum you went to the other
what museum was it, Adam?
he said a toaster.
oh, you saw the toaster, oh yes.
can you tell her which museum it was?
was it Science Museum?
or the Museum of Fine Arts?
or the Children's Museum?
what else did you see?
a snake.
birds.
a real bird.
did you see some birds that weren't real?
what kind of birds were they?
you don't remember?
hmm?
Adam, does it work with that little bow too?
oh, it's my turn?
yes.
it works.
it what?
what do you think?
at the same time?
well, how are you going to do that?
does that look like a macaroni, Adam?
that looks like an elbow, doesn't it?
where're the peppers?
what's a pepper?
what do you think that is?
why don't you look further inside the bag and see what you find?
I don't know, what do you think that is?
well, why don't you save that for a little while.
oh, I think you can.
you just have to get the paper off.
go ahead.
you're getting it.
that's right.
what happened?
do you have four there, Adam?
how many do you have?
he's not goING To what?
oh, that's a good idea.
each one?
which one goes the farthest?
which one goes the farthest?
and did they have a race, Adam?
let's put them all in one place to start.
did they roll?
who won?
oh, how could they all win?
oh.
what do you have to do to win?
what is that, Adam?
Adam, what about these cars?
aren't these like the cars that Harvey had?
why don't you do one thing at a time?
oh?
what kind of airplane?
I didn't know that airplanes had a horn.
you said beep beep.
who?
what's a full house?
careful, don't break it.
does it turn now?
no, the wheel.
what?
it turns when it's getting ready to go up in the sky.
why did you take my racers?
this is green.
green like the green light.
what does this mean?
how could an airplane go through a tunnel?
how could it?
I don't think it could go under it easily or through it.
what should we say, Adam?
do we go under a tunnel or do we go through a tunnel?
Adam, if we put this here and we all start racing who wins the
how does your car win?
alright, let's try.
and who's the winner?
yours what?
what happens when he has a flat tire?
can he keep on driving or does he have to stop?
he can?
with a flat tire?
Adam, did you tell her about your accident?
what happened?
you caught your toe?
no, you didn't cut your finger.
how did you catch
yes, last year.
but what happened to your toe?
no, it got caught in what?
his tricycle.
was it very bad?
it wasn't ?
we had to use the pliers.
no, you couldn't .
well, we can play a guessing game.
alright.
let's play it.
I don't think that's a car.
what do you think it is not?
you don't think that's a truck.
well, I don't think that's a bow.
no.

yes, that's something you take outside.
there are dishes in it.

you need a hug.
looks like you need a hug.
do you want me to give you a hug?
mmm.
could I have a kiss too?
very nice, thank you.
is that your favorite song now, ee_yay_ee_yay_oh?
it's only got three letters instead of the abc's like that has all
yep, the letters run off the tree.
juice, please.
did I hear please?
yup, it's on the table.
what's that?
a piece of wood?
a cutting board.
right, it's for cutting.
a walnut cutting board.
for cutting walnuts.
we have a bunch of walnuts upstairs.
yeah, we've had them for about four years now.
yum yum.
they're black walnuts, they're really hard to crack.
the person who gave them to us gave them to us because he couldn't
what do you have to do?
you have to boil them or something.
no, I just take a hammer and put them on the floor of
you'll have walnut crumbs.
hammer, hammer, clap, right.
pull, pull, hammer, hammer, clap.
that's right, who taught you that song?
Grandma.
do you want something in it?
no.
I think I should just start injecting it intravenously.
yeah, I'd like something in mine.
thank you.
a shot of brandy.
no, I was thinking about Irish Whisky actually.
actually, I find it has no effect on my being awake, or not being
yeah.
security blanket type.
I think the kitty smells my bunny on my hands.
your bunny?
I have a little bunny at home.
big bad wolf.
Mommy's here.
Child.
cereal, Cheerio.
oh, that's too bad.
missed it.
the Beast Master.
the president is giving his state of the union address tonight and
you want to drink up the milk?
drink your juice.
more cereal?
you want Chex or Cheerios?
or or both?
Chex.
Cheerios.
Cheerios.
we'd better buy some more Cheerios tomorrow.
um hmm.
milk.
some more milk.
the bug is eating it?
ants eating it.
that's not a bug, that's an ant.
Mommy's corrupting you already.
telling you the wrong names for things.
maybe Daddy should take you to.
which probably was last week or something, so we missed it again.
no, no, that's a week from tomorrow.
today.
P_one today.
yesterday's tomorrow.
which, I'll probably forget anyway.
yeah, Kean'll be here.
maybe I'll take him.
Kean'll be here for the week?
two weeks.
Kean is coming for two weeks?
two weeks, yes.
so you're not going down?
he's just staying?
he's skipping school for two weeks?
no, no, no, this is winter break.
oh, this is normal winter break for him?
yeah.
oh.
I'm not sure if it's one week or two weeks but at least a week.
Child, Kean is coming for a week.
yeah, he knows that.
who's coming on Friday?
do you remember who's coming on Friday in an airplane?
right.
Child.
are you going to Kean how you climbed out of the crib?
are you proud of yourself?
it wasn't so much fun to fall on your head though, was it?
what happens when you climb out of your crib.
do you fall on your head?
actually the second time he didn't land on his head.
oh.
oh.
he's learning to swing his feet around.
what he must do, he must just pull himself straight up and then
that's right.
that's the only way I can imagine.
and once he learns  to rotate around it'll be ok.
it's still a long drop.
he's , that's not that long if he
it's a soft rug.
mmm.
actually if he keeps doing it then I'll know.
yeah, if he keeps doing it we should block off the stairs and
no, that's what I mean, we'll lower the sides so that he can
no, I know that, but I mean also he'll probably just wander around in
unfortunately it's impossible to block off.
oh, the stairway, I think he knows not to go down the stairs by
yeah, you have blue marker on your hand.
that's because you were drawing yesterday, remember?
writing, because you were writing yesterday.
you want to wash your hands?
when you finish your breakfast you can wash your hands.
after breakfast.
actually those markers don't come off as easily as I had hoped.
water soluble, huh?
they say they're water soluble and I tested them out on myself.
I drew on myself and I washed it off and I drew on the table and
but somehow he gets it embedded better.
yeah.
did you wait till it dried before you washed it off or did you do it?
I probably didn't .
I was impatient.
oh.
today's Tuesday.
I don't know, you know your schedule, I don't .
you better go ask her if she doesn't mind waiting until eight.
otherwise I can take Child in.
Observer knows sign language, Child, you can talk to her in that.
where did you learn that?
oh, he doesn't .
Child has a little girl in his class with Down's syndrome. so they do some sign language with her, I think they do.
daddy went upstairs, he'll be right down.
right down.
broken?
what's broken?
a kiss?
that's a kiss broken?
no.
how could a kiss be broken?
you want to a kiss from mommy?

hug and a kiss.
very good.
oh.

he went upstairs.
he'll be right down.
right down.
are you all done with your cereal, Child?
you still eating?
careful.
you want to drink up the milk now?
do you want to drink up your juice first?
kisses must be fairly hard to learn.
he just learned them about a month ago.
he still hasn't learned to put them on anybody's cheek or anything.
sometimes if you rush over fast you can get it on your cheek.
they really do melt hearts of stone.
ok, Child, it's hard to drink while you're kissing.
all done with the juice.
all done with the milk too?
all done.
ok, thank you.
can you wipe your hands and face?
then you can go wash your hands if you want.
do you want to go wash the milk all off of your hands?
on your fingers too?

you comb and mommy will brush.
oh, mommy didn't do such a great job of fixing this.
no, we still shouldn't touch it very much.
the glue didn't set very well.
maybe it just is broken in a bad place.
it's still very mushy.
well, we'll leave it over there.
no, sweetheart, it's still broken.
you can use the comb but not the brush.
no comb?
Child, I'm sorry but the brush isn't working very well.

do you want to read the story?
let's finish the story and then it's time  to get dressed.
ok, now it's time

one of the things Dennis did with Child was he just put the camera
and you know when you close the door and it's quiet for an hour and
it's wonderful.
it's a good way to see them on their own.

what's my other name?
what's that name you call me a lot and I have to say to

also here's one thing that I think is neat about this.
the back window, oops.
falls off.
falls off.
it goes off.
Child, did it break?
there.
oh, it opens.
see?
it opens so that you can load things into the back.
and then it comes down.
oops.
do you think Observer's going camping with that truck?
now.
who lights the matches?
that's right.
does Child light the matches?
cause Child's too little.
now this, I'm sure you've never seen one of these before.
that's a silly name, isn't it?
do you have, you don't have, do you have a tractor like this?
no, I didn't think so, cause this is a very unusual sort of tractor.
it looks a little like the ones at Drumlin Farm though, doesn't it?
not quite the same but it looks similar.
the ones that you sat on?
oh, you got to sit on a tractor?
yes.
they've got real antique ones there.
really?
you can just sit on them and climb on them.
huh.
I've never been to Drumlin Farms.
I should.
it's nice.
yeah.
it's not far from here, right?
yeah, it's in Place.
it takes fifteen minutes.
it's fun.
yeah.
you don't stay there all day.
you stay there for two hours.
right.
but it's good.
right.
you can just wander around.
you know, it's not structured.
his favorite thing is diggers and they've got
hmm.
is making funny
Child, what's this?
that's okay, you just
oh, that reminds me that I should give you the consent form.
okay.
I wanted to ask you, too, uhm, I forgot to ask you on the telephone.
what I'd like to do is wait until the end to.
okay, that's fine.
to give you the full information
that's fine.
no problem.
just so the interaction as easy as possible.
sign it down here?
yeah.
shall I do it?
do you want me to try to do it?
rehook them?
shall I try to hook them?
let's see.
okay.
there.
oh oh.
unhooked again.
that's silly, isn't it?
who.
Child, look, the door opens.
is there anything inside this camper?
hmm?
it has a hose?
hose or holes?
is that a hose?
you know what that is?
that's some kind of steam pipe, I think.
you tell Observer what that is.
you know exactly what that is.
what is that?
that's right.
it is a smokestack?
say, everything with an engine has a smokestack, doesn't it?
uhhuh.
this also has a hook though.
you might be able to hook the camper on the back.
you could try.
let's see.
will it hook?
uh, no, you know what?
this is not a good hook.
in fact, oh, I see, that's the seat.
oh, alright.
well, maybe it will hook.
oh, Child.
yes.
there we go.
she did it, look at that.
now the tractor can go camping.
mhm, silly, huh?
is there anybody driving the tractor?
no?
are you driving the tractor?
maybe Chuck could drive the tractor.
think Chuck could?
or is Chuck too big?
too big, yeah.
who's Chuck?
oh, that's Chuck.
can I see Chuck?
can I look at him?
you need a Kleenex, Child?
shall Momma go get you a Kleenex?
huh?
why don't you stop picking your nose and Momma get you a Kleenex?
does Chuck come out of here or does Chuck only sit in here?
he comes out?
that's a good boy.
I'll let you take him out, cause I'm afraid that I'll hurt him if
let Mommy hold your Kleenex and you take him out.
you tell Observer it's easy to take him out?
it is?
well, can you show me?
sometimes it's hard for little boys.
it's hard.
we thought it was easy but it's hard.
it's easy for mommies and Observers.
it's hard for little boys.
let's see.
now let's see.
see, Chuck comes out when we drop the digger.
I had him tied in for a while cause.
because it was so easy to get him out?
okay.
there we go.
now.
how did Chuck get his name?
do you know that, Child?
I don't know if he knows.
we had our yard landscaped and the guy came with one of these and it
I see.
and that's Child's best toy.
Child, can you tell Observer what that's called?
this?
what is this?
it's not a cement mixer, that I can tell, right?
no.
uh.
and it's not a garbage dumper, is it?
and it's not a tractor, is it?
well, it's not a car, is it?
and it's not a bus.
uh.
Child.
is she teasing you?
you know my knowledge of vehicles is pretty limited.
I bet she doesn't know what it's called.
maybe you can help her.
you're right.
tell her what it is.
cause you know about all the different ones, hmm?
we spend a lot of time watching those.
it looks like it dumps something.
does it dump things?
what, what kinds of things does it dump?
it dumps dirt!
uhhuh.
what were we dumping before we came in today?
outside?
right outside your school, what we were dumping out there?
leaves?
so you can use it to dump a lot of things.
good.
is it called.
Little Digger?
oh.
do we use it for something else too?
pass it back over here, Child.
now let's do something else.
remember what else we?
something in your book.
I'll make it and you see if you remember what it was called, okay?
hook it back up?
okay.
there we go.
you remember what this was called, Child?
when we were pulling logs?
you're silly.
why don't you take your fingers out of your nose and do something?
remember what this is called in your book?
in our big truck book?
when it pulls the log.
was it called a log skidder?
a log skidder?
it pulls the logs along.
and a log skidder can also be a front end loader, huh?
did you know all about vehicles before?
no.
lots of library books.
they just put all new pipes in in
he he just has always really loved that.
yeah.
so.
yeah.
he gets to the point where we were allowed to stand in the ditch for
we're not supposed to but, but they let us because they let us
right.
right.
oh.
this has such big wheels, doesn't it, compared to the wheels on a
the wheels on a car are really small.
what's this one called, Child?
what's this truck called?
is it called anything we know?
it's not called a pickup truck, I don't think.
in fact, you know what, Child?
I've got actually another one of those.
oh, lookit.
are those different?
more.
more what?
Child, are those different?
are they different?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
what's different about them?
they look pretty much the same to me.
did we have one of those for lunch?
what did we do?
oh, thank you.
can I eat this?

yeah?

or do you think it's something else?
a lemon.
that's a lemon.
great.

sit up.
it really squooshes right up.
whoa, look at it.
I bet that feels nice.

woh.
we know what ducks like to eat.
what do they eat?

where is it.
or.

oh, Child.
boom.
and out it comes.

that's not too good.
you should be a little bit more gentle with that.
okay?
cause it will break and then you willn't be able to play with them.
Child.
you know what?
I have some more animals, although you don't seem to like the
but do you want to see some more animals that I have?
okay.

these are not quite as exciting, but.
this is neat.
lion, yeah.
oh, Child, look at this.
I think they're just going to go fix the building.
they look like people who are going to fix the building.
they look like people who don't know how to close a door, don't
Mommy's coming right back.
I'm just going to close the door.
there.
what?
who.
Child.
Child, take it easy with the things.
did we decide what this was?
yeah, do you know what that is?
that's something that eats dog food, Child.
now you can say.
this eats dog food.
what do you, what is that?
it does?
well, what does that mean it is?
Child?
do you want to go home?
okay.
I don't care for that, alright?
it's naughty.
now you don't need to hit your mom.
okay?
why don't you ask Observer if she's got anything else there to show?
I do.
do you want to see it?
okay.
yes.
that's right.
what?
you want to see what else? okay.
yeah.
we're going to come to the end soon.

Child?
why don't you try not hitting them, hon?
now this
what do you think it is?
why don't you look at that she's got?
another one what?
why don't you see what Observer's got there?
what do you think that is?
a camel?
no.
it's the right color.
who that looks like, Child?
that looks a little bit like Razmah.
does that look like Razzie to you?
did you eat dog food?
did you eat?
yes?
yuck.
I'm not anxious to do that.
was it good?
alright.
there's one more animal.
your uncles used to eat dog food, Child.

it's a kind of dog.
can you say that?
collie?
whoops.
that's like Razzie, is something called maybe like a sheepdog and
here it is.

poodles have to go to the barber to get their hair cut.
isn't that silly?
right.
see how they get shaved here?
isn't that silly?
their fur is like this usually and then they get shaved, here and
who else gets shaved?

it's tea?
okay.
hey, Child, you remember how the little bear made birthday soup?
it could sort of be like that too, couldn't it?
for all his friends?
I think maybe you have too many things in there.

oh.
oh, I don't have a cup.
could you serve us cups first?
I see some cups over there.
why don't you put the tea down and go get some cups for us.
I'd like yellow.
ask Observer what color she'd like.
okay, purple would be nice.
you're going to have a tough time  giving her purple, Child.

they're all cooking.
how long
okay.
how long will it take for the muffins to cook?

it doesn't work really well on carpets, does it?
you tell Observer your Daddy has one of these, a real one.
really?
do you ride ever in it?
yes?
that must be very exciting.
it's not working very well right now though, is it, Child?
we haven't actually ridden in it, but we've turned it on and
that's very scary, when you're right inside of it it's very noisy.

yeah.
neat.
I think, I think he's really interesting.
most of my friends think he's a jerk and I don't know why.
oh, really?
because I don't know if they're judging him, I mean I've watched
I don't know if they judge him because he's a little bit effeminate.
I'm not sure if

I like it.
the part, the pretending part I don't know if you know.
he's too young for it, I think I'm not, it's kind of boring, the
mmhm.
but the part when he goes on tours I think is interesting.

and there are repeats.
the one that's on at five o' clock at night is the same one that's on

you can't use that one.
you can tell her about the one that you have if you want, but you can't touch hers.
no.
I can't either.
that's a special one.
remember I told you Observer likes to listen to how children talk?
we taped your voice at home, didn't we?
with your tape recorder?
remember you talked, and then we could hear you talking?
the same thing's going to happen in hers.
Child

actually, Child, I brought something new this time.
I brought a book that I thought maybe you and Parent might like to

there's one page here in particular that I thought might interest
you love books, huh, Child?
look at this?

that is wonderful.
and a bridge which isn't working very well.
we're going to ask Santa Claus for some new train tracks, because this

they have to be taken to the job on a flatbed.
I think Chuck's falling out of his digger, Child.
looks like he's falling out.
can you put him back in?
there we go.
I don't know.
thank you, honey.
I don't know, ask her.
well, it's hard to answer actually because I had a big breakfast.
maybe it's just delicious.
yeah, it's very good, isn't it?
did you have some already this morning?
this is his second breakfast too.
a whole bowl of milk and another bowl of.
huh, Child.
Child, what else do we have.
you want to put the cereal aside for a little while and show
you had a book you wanted to show Observer, didn't you?
oh yeah?
with a lot of pictures in it.
want to go find that book?
that's okay, the cereal will stay right there, nobody's going to take
it's right over there, you can see it.
oh, it's on the bookshelf, your car and truck book.
do you see it?
oh.
it's right at the beginning there.
what?
that's a bulldozer?
little tiny one.
Child, why don't you come over here, that way we can both look at it
little tiny one, yeah.
you did?
was that a good idea?
it was the first and last time he's ever colored.
hey, Child, come around here, that way Observer can see the top of
you sit over this way.
look, otherwise she's going to see everything upside down.
there you go.
now you can tell her all about the pictures.
what happened here?

you know what that's called.
that's the great old digger.
that's silly, isn't it?
you tell Observer what these are down here, these feet.
stabilizers?
what are those for?
that's right, they go down and up.
that's so the digger willn't tip over while he's digging.
makes them nice and strong.
oh, yeah.
and he's a little too big for the digger, isn't he, Child?
he's a little bit too big.
he does?
ahah.
they do look like eyes.
ah huh.

what's your blanket's name?
what's that blanket called?
special, that's called special.
this is his best blanket.
oh.
well, it has wonderful animals on it, doesn't it?
someone gave him that when he was born for him to crawl around on.

that is great.
do you mow the lawn a lot in here?

no, not right now, hon.
Child.
Child, come here for sec, mom wants to tell you something.
I'm going to get you, I'm going to catch you!
you know why you can't have any now?
because you know why you can't have any now?
because this is like school, do you have a rule in school about no
when you're playing and talking there's no bubble gum, is there?
but when Observer goes home, then you can have a piece.
ok?
can you tell me about some more of these?
remember that I brought a book last time?
oh, we've been waiting, huh.
I don't know if my book is actually as much fun as yours.
but theirs might be some things in here that you'd like to look at.
I think it looks neat.
come and see, come on down.
you can see from up there?
okay.
yeah.
come down here and see.
do you know what this is?
it's not a regular plane.
you know what it's called?
it's a rocket.
it's like a little bit the shuttle, Child.
right, it's a little bit like the space shuttle.
well, the space shuttle goes up in the sky.
remember?
they don't have a space shuttle on here.
they just have this, uh, rocket on here.
oh, look it.
Child, what about this?
know what this is?
what is that?
that's a dolphin?
well, that's close.
it's an airplane.
it's an airplane with a propeller.
and this is an airplane without a propeller.
what does it have if it doesn't have a propeller?
what makes it go?
jets.
jets make it go?
yeah, do you want to see the jets?
this picture has jets in it.
you come down here and see the jets?
here, you can put it there.
here?
see the smoke coming out of the back of the jets?
see that?
what's this one called over here?
you have one of those in your airport.
over over in that, over in that blue box you have one.
watch out for the tape recorder.
yeah, there's something else in there though that's in the picture.
is it a helicopter?
see the helicopter?
yup.
that one has jets.
oh, both do.
they both have jets?
show Observer where the jets are.
oh, that's a jet?
that's where the engines are, that's where the, the smoke comes out
to make the plane and the helicopter go.
the engines were inside this little box, and the the smoke comes out.
no, well it's kind of pretend.
look in the front here.
you see those little lines?
those are the engines.
there's not really a whole engine in there, it's kind of pretend.
yeah.
what are these?
um, here.
yeah.
it comes out the back, the back of the jets, right where your thumb
who's going to go on an airplane next week, Child?
you are?
where are you going?
remember what it's called?
want me to tell Observer?
to Hawaii.
wow.
do you know people in Hawaii?
no?
it's just a vacation?
oh yeah?
yeah.
we're going for a vacation, and we're going to take Karen.
she's going to babysit.
oh.
it's going to be nice.
that's nice.
be gentle.
yeah.
which goes faster?
a helicopter, or a plane?
wooho, wooho!
the airplane, ha, Child.
look at that.
you be gentle now.
ok?
be gentle.
let's see what else we can find in this picture, Child.
yeah.
I wonder whether you know what this is.
do you know what that is?
I don't think so, we've never talked about it.
oh, this has smoke too.
that's probably more like a water jet though.
this is under the water.
that's right, this is called a submarine, Child.
yup.
do you know who used to work on submarines?
Grandaddy did.
he used to be a navigator on a submarine.
Mommy's been on a submarine.
it's really neat.
hmm.
my father was, he was in the Navy.
hmm.
Grandaddy used to work on those, that used to be his job.
well, that's what it was.
his job was to be a navigator.
that means he was driving around.
well, someday maybe we can go on one.
actually we might be able to go on one in Hawaii.
maybe.
or a big boat?
oh, Child, what's this?
yeah, where's it going?
where does the school bus go?
it's funny, in the middle of that picture of all the country, a
mmhm, mmhm.
where does the school bus go?
are you looking for the school?
hmm.
it's not in the picture.
is it?
yeah, right, back in the village.
you're absolutely right.
mommy didn't even see that.
mmhm, mmhm.
no, it's very small.
isn't it.
what else?
did you see this tall thing back there?
I bet that's a church.
because that's the steeple.
hmm.
that could be the school, you're right.
absolutely.
what's this right here that the school bus is about to drive over?
it can't go where?
because there's no street?
well, you know what I think it is?
I think the street's over there but I think we can't see it.
he can go over here.
that's his car and he's going to drive over.
yeah.
why can't he drive over it?
oh, he's not driving it?
I see smoke behind that school bus, you see it all?
tell Observer when we see smoke coming out of cars?
was it
does it have to be warm or cold?
it does?
but only when it's really cold, right?
does Daddy's car make more smoke than the Subaru does?
really?
we've got an old nineteen sixty Mercedes and it starts up and he
but you can't ride in that car, can you?
why not?
really.
hmm, so you can't put in, um, a babyseat either?
no?
you tell, you tell Observer
because Daddy gives him drive rides up and down the driveway in it.
oh, that's a
very special, isn't it?
and one time you went around the block.
that was very special, wasn't it?
which car do you like more, the Mercedes or the Subaru?
he's always liked the Mercedes.
expensive taste for a baby, huh?
ha, Child?
he, the, you know the symbol in the front, we're driving down the
your big Jeep's in the kitchen.
the big one that that makes a lot of noise?
I think it's in the kitchen.
look on the other side of the counter.
over by your tape recorder.
is it over there?
keep walking.
over by the sink, Child.
do you see it?
no, oh.
here it is, sorry, it's over here, Child.
here it is.
it's over by the baby's bed.
did Mommy fool you?
mommy didn't know the answer.
you have money too?
oh, lookit.
oh, what kind of money is that?
mommy money?
good answer, Child.
oh, let's see.
let's see.
gentle, gentle.
what about you
Child, don't throw things, please.
right, don't throw.
don't throw.
why don't you get your tiger and show
it's beautiful.
this is the neatest, this is the most cuddly tiger I've ever seen.
oh, this is wonderful.
she can take it out.
this is wonderful.
this is a great tiger.
isn't he neat?
it's so realistic.
no, in a little while, Child.
you're not going to get it, Child, so you don't have to bother whining.
I know, I bubblegum.
that's my fault because I used to love it all the time.
Child okay?
but you'll have to wait.
alright?
well, if, if you want to go see the.
mommy knows a special place.
but you'll have to wait for a
no.
okay?
why don't we look at this page.
Child, here's some more picture that I thought you might be interested in.
look, what do you see?
I see a lott a new things.
this is a great book.
yeah.
is it like yours?
is it like Daddy's ?
who else is it like?
who who brings a lawnmower to our house?
who comes and mows the lawn?
I do?
no, I don't .
oh, the landscapers.
yeah.
do they mow the lawn with a big lawnmower much bigger than this?
yeah?
do you know what these other things are here?
Grandaddy brought one of these over one day.
what was it?
yeah.
and what did he do with the saw?
what did he saw?
yeah.
the doors, huh?
what's this here?
I don't know if you know what that's called.
firemen use those.
when there was a bad fire, and they could get into the house
it's called an ax.
chopped the wood.
hmm?
does who have it?
Grandaddy has an ax?
yes, he does.
he chops wood with his ax.
firewood for the fireplace.
do you have a fireplace?
where's your fireplace?
what do we do in that fireplace?
no, we don't chop things.
we chop things outside.
do we make fires in the fireplace?
hmm, are they good fires or bad fires?
that's right.
why are they good fires?
because they're not hurting anybody?
hmm.
what do you have up in your room in case there's a bad fire?
goes out the window, doesn't it?
just in case.
well, we're going to leave it upstairs for now.
we're going to, we're going to leave it upstairs for now.
let's see what else is in the picture.
oh, Child, I see some other things that I bet you know.
I bet you know what this is called.
we've got one of these in the kitchen, I think.
what's that?
what is that big thing?
and this.
are those paint brushes?
do you have paint brushes?
what's this called here?
a wrench?
you get the paint off the counter.
run down and show Observer, that's okay you can reach it.
it's right up there.
oh, it's on there, I'll help you.
it's on here.
here it is.
what do you do with this?
a big long one?
that's because he has another one that's this long.
so this one's much bigger, huh?
I see.
I see.
I see.
well, we'll paint another time.
is pretty messy right now.
we show Observer what this is called?
does it look like the one in the book, Child?
yeah.
well, that looks nice.
you must have a good time with that.
oop, you got it.
good boy.
that's right.
what are you missing though?
oop, oop, oh.
no, we don't paint people.
we don't paint people.
do you ever paint yourself?
well, that's good.
I'm glad to hear that.
why, why don't you put the brush back in and let's look at some more?
ok?
because we're not going to be painting now.
we can't paint in the family room, Child.
you want to keep the brush out and we'll close up the paint?
okay.
well, we're not going to paint right now.
Child.
everything reminds him of something else.
yeah, everything.
right.
Child, why don't you show Observer your tape recorder?
she's never seen the kind that you have.
come here.
let me hold the paper.
oh, that's really a nice tape recorder.
pretty nice, huh?
and tell Observer you can tape your own voice too.
you have a little microphone in here, don't ya.
you can record your own voice.
that's what she's doing with her tape recorder.
she's taping what you sound like.
no, we need a special tape to do that.
you can't do it on the regular tapes.
you tell her what this button's for with the tape on it?
what's that button do?
rewinding?
this is so great because now he can get back to the songs he
let me see if I can find the tape that has that part.
this is the only one that you have that will redo recording.
ok?
pushing the buttons on it.
you do, mmhm.
take your time until you get it nice and straight.
you have to put this side by your good boy.
push down really hard.
there, now you can talk.
can talk and see what happens.
you say.
hello, tape recorder.
I already did.
you say it.
say.
hello, tape recorder.
okay, let's stop it and see what happens.
let's see.
see if we hear anything.
that's something different, isn't it?
who is that, Child?
who is that on that tape?
who's talking?
is that Mommy?
huh?
let's look at some more pictures.
yeah, get some more pictures.
Mommy's going to keep this right over here for a minute.
look at this, Child.
do you want to record too while we're talking?
yeah.
let's record while we're talking.
you push record and then you come over and talk about the pictures.
put it right there with Observer's .
put it right next to hers.
that is such a good idea.
there we go, now they're both listening to us talk.
ok?
perfect.
great.
Child, I see a picture of something we found in the wood pile.
what was that?
well, it's something a little bigger than a worm.
remember Mommy was a little scared of it?
what's that called?
a snake.
it scared me, didn't it?
we were bringing in wood for the hurricane and Mummy picked up a
hmm.
and did you come over and look at it?
and then it ran away, didn't it?
Mummy didn't like it.
it was moving, that's right.
mommy didn't think it was moving and you knew it was, ha?
what else did we find in the wood pile?
do you remember?
that's right.
ay, a mouse.
what next?
what?
you didn't ?
only Mommy did.
but you saw its nest, didn't you?
I showed you the, where it was living?
mommy scared it.
why I didn't mean to.
I was bringing the wood in and then the mouse had to run away.

seemed like a good idea.
why don't we not put them on the floor, Child, okay, you usually
Child.
you know why?
you know why?
because they'll get on the rug, and that's not good.
otherwise we'll be putting them away, okay?
if you can't put them on the bucket, we'll have to put them away.
okay?
because your your rule usually is that you have to color up on the
right Child?

okay.
where'd it go?

oh yeah.
I thought the drawings themselves were nice.

a lot of the books that I looked at aren't so clear.
we have a bunch of books by him.

no, that was Child's .
oh, we have a bunch of books by him.

what is that?
oh, thank you.
there you go, you show Observer what was in the picture.
there ya go.
oh, which one is that on here?
which one's big?
and which one's small?
oh, this end is bigger than this end.
you're right.
that's called perspective.
well, because this end is closer.
see if we can do it with this rolling pin.
this end is closer to you, so it looks bigger.
and this end is farther away, so it looks smaller.
but they're really the same size.
in this picture they're really the same size too.
you'll learn about that when you get to about fifth grade, Child.
isn't it weird how they notice things like that?
yeah.
that's really nice.
what do we make with that?

he must have been a very little baby then.
he was big enough to make a good mess.
wasn't it?
Child, you have to be really
remember the rule about this?
where does the rolling pin always stay?
on the floor.
it stays on the floor because it's so big and heavy.
you can roll it around with you.
what is that for?
that's for making pies but mommy doesn't use that.
it's for rolling out pie dough so the pie dough willn't stick on the
but Mommy doesn't like that, I just use wax paper instead.

I don't like things with parts.
like all the Fisher Price toys are little people and animals.
let's see, what is it?
that's a dinosaur.
you almost can't buy anything without batteries anymore.
batteries or else it all comes apart.
we used to try to keep everything on the shelves and it's just
my husband got to be fanatic about it.
and finally I said.
what's the sense.
they've got to play with it, and it's all going in baskets.
oh, you've got the elephant.
here's the porcupine.
show Parent the porcupine.
she was throwing it before, wasn't she?
are you going to share it?
doesn't Parent get something?
hoarding everything.
you know what she will do lately that I thought was kind a cute?
if Parent cries or gets hurt she'll offer her her blanket.
Parent doesn't have a special blanket yet.
I don't know why, I guess I just haven't had one for her.
but to her that's really important to give her sister the blanket.
and I thought, well, how sweet to think, well, that'll comfort her.
when she gets hurt she gets her blanket.
she gives Parent her blanket and sometimes her teddy bear.
hi.
hi there, squirt.
they're as different as night and day.
are they?
Parent's very quiet and easygoing and Jamie not now but she gets
she does talk a lot.
what are you doing?
tells me which way to go in the car.
what are you doing?
you better not do that.
you know what?
you might choke.
let's see.
don't pull that thing out, cause you know what'll happen?
all the air will come out of the duck and then he'll be a flat
he willn't squeak anymore.
what's that?
right there with the orange stripes?
seems to me that those were twenty nine or thirty two dollars
ninety six.
what is it?
it's the Kuzoo, the Cabbage Patches' , um, pet, I guess.
oh.
Parent's looking at the book.
maybe you should tell Parent what some of the things in the book
poor Parent.
she's always going to be the little underdog.
oh, boom.
go in there.
I don't think it'll go in there.
where's the porcupine?
he's lost.
I think he's behind you.
what's that thing?
is that Parent's or yours?
it's yours?
oh, let me see.
what toys?
I think she said she had a lot of toys.
I never heard her say that before.
I'll say you do have a lot of toys.
oh, boom!
mhm.
poor Parent, ow!
say.
Parent, I'm sorry.
can you say?
I'm sorry.
to Parent?
Parent's the one with the handmedowns.
you poor little thing.
Parent can touch the porcupine.
I fix it on here?
yes, you can.
here.
put him in the boat and go for a ride, ok?
is that the zipper?
where's the other truck?
right there.

you can't get him on here?
let's see.
you can't ?
you're just having trouble?
here.
take him for a ride.
you can't ?
try putting the other horsie on.
try putting the brown horsie on the truck.
where's the other horse?
right there.
right by the collie.
you know where the other horse is?
show mommy the brown horse.
I know.
he can hop through here.
look.
the porcupine can go through the hole.
see?
he's jumping.
can you do that?
do you study their speech or just the way they behave?
speech.
I think it'd be really interesting to study how they behave, but I
you know, I mean they do so many things.
mhm.
you want more toys?
I didn't bring any.
why don't you show me some of your toys?
you want to show her Investigator_one what some of your toys are?
what's Jamie's toys?
Parent's sister is eleven and they play.
it's like I feel it's all I can do to take care of them.
and I was thinking the other day that we don't sit down and.
but like she doesn't know all her colors or her numbers and things.
I know other people who have two year olds.
it's not like they're extra smart.
it's just that people have taken time.
and she will pick up on things.
if you tell her something she'll remember it.
but I just haven't had the time.
I've been so busy with diapers, and keeping everybody clean, that I
well, then I thought that she will pick up on it.
it's a learned thing.
colors are learned and numbers and.
colors, I think, kids really don't get them down until they're five.
they really have a hard time.
are you going to take my microphone?
where are some of your toys, Jamie?
right there?
you've got so many!
you like the porcupine, don't you?
he's sticky.
see his quills?
they'd hurt your fingers if he was real.
see he's smiling.
can you see him smile?
see him smile?
isn't he cute?
he's too big, see?
the other day she was, um, I have a little night light in the
and she said.
Parent, see the light?
see the bear going up the stairs?
she.
like now she's talking in just words but she does say sentences.
yeah, I.
you've said some sentences while I've been here.
I've heard you.
you'll just get used to her and then she'll be gone.
be careful.
you'll choke.
ok, well don't choke on it, ok?
can't Parent have one?
give Parent one to play with, ok?
Parent might cry.
Parent wants a toy.
poor Parent.
porcupine.
you like him?
there's the tail.
that's it.
that's as long as it is.
I don't have any more.
that's all the toys.
want to put the toys in the bag?
no?
oh, alright.
is that your big bunny over there?
behind you?
that yellow bunny?
thank you, Parent.
where's your baby doll?
where is the baby doll?
it's outside?
it better not be outside.
it's cold outside.
she likes those little dolls because they're more easy to manage
she'll take em upstairs and sleep with them.
she's got little dogs and.
my daughter won em at Chuckey Cheese or something.
I shouldn't have said that.
I know you want to go to Chuckey Cheese but.
maybe another day, ok?
you can't do everything at once.
when you're not doing something Parent can do it.
poor Parent.
that's a girl.
here's the boy.
see the girl?
there's a man, and a mommy and a baby and a brother and a sister.
see red?
no, that's purple.
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, grey, brown, white, black.
that's a plum.
that's a mouse.
peas.
strawberries.
peas for Thanksgiving.
those are strawberries.
and carrots.
we'll get them at the store after a while, ok.
what are you going to eat on Thanksgiving?
I should put my turkey out for Thanksgiving.
no, no, no, no, don't do that.
show me the bunny.
oh.
he's cute, isn't he?
how old is Parent?
about a year.
she was a year October first.
can you say.
tape recorder?
tape recorder.
this is called a microphone.
can you say.
microphone?
they're fascinated by things that you wouldn't think.
that's a nice fire truck.
do you know what that is?
where's the turkey?
we have a turkey for Thanksgiving.
there's a turkey.
see the turkey on the door?
oh, you have a turkey?
my mom was an art teacher, and these things.
last year Santa was.
ho ho.
now he's finally Santa Clause.
Santa Clause will be coming, hmm?
you want to see em?
well, he's not here yet.
it's not time.
that's his stocking.
a stocking with toys.
let's see .
no, I don't have any more toys.
I have some paper but that's all.
it's all empty.
see?
it's not very interesting.
what's that?
is that your racoon?
this thing?
yeah, I saw that.
did you cut your hair?
it looks ok.
I didn't tell you my name.
my name is Investigator_one.
can you say.
Investigator_one?
it's a hard name, isn't it.
Jamie, why don't you get one of your books?
want to show Investigator_one one of your books?
there's a pineapple.
pineapple and watermelon.
pineapple?
there's some in the refrigerator.
it's getting cold.
I think Daddy put a can of pineapple in.
can you wait until lunch time?
no?
you're going to have to.
are you ready for a nap?
where's the book?
I think it's right, oops, behind you.
hi there, squirt.
it's amazing that these kids ever make it until they're adults, with
what do you want to find?
look at the giraffe.
it's a big one.
see the giraffe?
careful.
where's the church?
the church?
come here.
see?
the steeple.
there's the church right there.
that's it.
that's the church.
it has to stay in the book.
it has to stay in the book.
you saw Shannon's church last night.
oh no, you didn't .
you were home soaking your fingers.
she touched the curling iron.
the second time in a week that she's touched it.
then the eleven year old gets in trouble and she said.
why.
I said.
you should have told her it was on.
she said.
but it wasn't on, I just turned it off.
I said.
but it's still hot when it's off.
I thought she would have learned, you know, from touching it the
can I see your fingers?
are they better?
they're not better?
which ones are the owie ones?
can you show mommy?
did you burn your fingers?
show mommy where you touched Shannon's curling iron.
are they better?
it's not better?
cut a hole in your pants.
Uncle Doug gave you this sweat suit and it was in real good shape.
don't make it bigger.
I'm going to get you a kleenex for your nose, ok?
Investigator_one.
can you say.
Investigator_one?
don't push her.
poor Parent.
you're mean to Parent.
poor little Parent.
now you're going to give her the horse to be nice.
see, that's how you are.
you're mean and then you act nice afterwards, huh?
right there by the couch.
would you wipe your nose for me?
just a little bit.
here.
I think she's taken notice that I'm here now.
can you pick up?
why don't you get the toys together?
put all the toys on the rug here.
put the toys on the bear.
so when Investigator_one goes she willn't forget em.
you know what?
I think the porcupine is behind you.
right back there.
where's the what?
the truck?
there's two trucks.
where's the other truck?
there they are.
two trucks.
they're driving on you.
they don't fit.
they're the same size.
she's just started singing lately.
she makes up these little songs, and sings aloud.
are you biting that dog?
poor dog.
he's crying.
now she's really convinced.
at least we both know how to whine.
did you hear the doggie?
you're biting his feet.
ouch!
are you going to have a dog for lunch?
where is the other dog?
is there another one?
there's two horses and one dog, I think.
there's only one.
here's the zebra.
that's his tail.
where's the other, where's the elephant's tail?
that's a duck.
that's his wing.
that's another wing.
by his feet.
there's his tail.
that's his feet.
that's his feet.
there's his tail in the back.
there's his tail.
see?
there.
there's his tail.
isn't it funny they know to turn everything to look at the tail?
don't bite it, cause Investigator_one has to take that duck back to
yeah, I have to take him back with me.
and she'll get in trouble.
right.
you want to put him back in the bag for her?
you want the duck.
where's Parent's pacifier?
she's knows what Parent's pacifier is, but for some reason she
Parent's mouth.
cause it goes in Parent's mouth.
mm.
hmm?
you're sharing?
you gave Parent the ball.
I don't know how many balls they went through this summer, because
so we have all these deflated beach balls.
I see something I better take from Parent before Parent.
ahhah.
why don't you give the duck a ride on your boat?
go get your big boat and give the duck a ride on the boat.
that's a good idea.
where's the duck?
now he's lost.
I think he's by Parent's leg.
mhm.
ok.
you going to give him a ride now?
tell Parent you'll be right back.
that's not the boat.
where's your boat?
he looks pretty up there.
you think if you put him there that he can stay here, right?
it's terrible not to be able to have anything on the coffee table.
I can't stand it.
my table cloth is gone, my knicknacks, my cactus, except that
everything is in disarray for years to come.
he can sit right here.
see?
it's a good place for him right here.
why don't you put him on the rug, on the floor, on the bear?
put the boat on the bear on the floor.
oh, that's pretty there.
I like that.
he's happy.
you know when you're around your children all the time you get used
like I told you, for writing she says and I know what
every time you go somewhere, or if you're going to leave em with
she speaks pretty clearly though.
are you biting my duck again?
I have to take that duck back with me.
what if it's broken?
don't break his beak.
don't bite him.
Investigator_one has to.
look, now she's doing what she saw Jamie do.
he willn't fit.
put him in the front.
you forgot that your boat toots, didn't you?
he's too fat?
isn't that funny.
we don't have anything that squeaks and of all things that
they don't have any squeak toys.
he doesn't fit there, honey.
he'll fit right here.
see?
he fits there.
see?
you're too big.
we were on vacation in a big boat.
did you go on a big boat?
did you ever go to Centerville in Toronto?
the little amusement park on the island?
isn't it cute?
we had a nice day.
it was absolutely pouring and we thought, well, we'll go.
and there was nobody there but yet it was still open.
when we were on the train, I said.
oh God please, can't you stop?
this is really bad.
when we got off the train it was finished.
the rain was done and we had a real nice day.
that's great.
went on a big boat.
are you biting the horse too?
you're biting his mouth.
don't bite the horse.
take him out of your mouth, dirty.
you want to go on a horsey?
outside?
we don't have very many places for kids just to ride ponies and
I guess because the insurance is probably so high.
horse or pony.
yeah, I don't know if they have it any more.
what's that?
what's that?
this blue thing?
what do you do with this blue thing?
tell Parent not to touch.
you know it's too bad you're not able to videotape at the same
lulls in the conversation, their actions speak too.
yeah.
we always have the person who came to see the kids do the
but I know you miss a lot.
are most children shy when you pop in like this?
yeah.
which is too bad in a way because even though they're talking.
yeah.
it's too bad you can't do a month's study, just getting friendly
calm down.
phone books and catalogs.
they used to be stacked up very neatly.
oh.
where is em?
in the summer.
it's too cold outside right now.

isn't it funny how books will bring them out?
I think that's all.
it's too cold.
it's freezing.
there's some shoes.
you have some, don't you?
can you tell Parent to get out of there and close the door?
thank you.
there's some more shoes.
yeah?
mm.

mm.
there's a gumball machine.

my father used to tell us to be careful, that Santa Clause
my eleven year old was talking to her girlfriend the other day and
do you still believe in Santa?
she said.
yes, my mother says if you really believe that there is
and I thought it's really funny they don't really want to give it
that's kind a cute in a way.
it makes you feel really responsible.
they don't tell anybody because they make fun of them.
when she gets older.
Jamie, that book is getting all torn up and you willn't be able to
yeah.
can I have the catalog?
please?
may I please?
wait a minute?
can you pick up Investigator_one's toys for her, and animals?
yeah, I have to get ready to go home in a little while.

I'd like that.

here's the fire engine.
see they're both red, but this one is
it's different.

of course sometimes you've seen fire engines with long ladders on
so maybe that's confused you, but this is a crane.
see the hook?
see this right here?
do you see that?
that's called a hook.
can you say that word?
hook.
please, don't jump.
please, don't jump.
mhm.
you're jumping on the ground.
makes a big noise, doesn't it?
look at this!
looks like summertime, doesn't it?
do you know what it is now?
it's not summer time now, is it?
do you see the snow outside?
we were talking about winter, weren't we?
and and spring will come and it will get green again.
we were talking about that.
do you remember?
not really.
we talked about that a little bit.
what do you see there?
that's my microphone.
remember that?
that's my tape recorder.
you know what I do with it?
oh, I don't think you do.
can you say.
no, what do you do?
can you say, can you ask what she does?
well, what I do with it is, it listens to your voice.
and so when I go home it helps me remember what you said.

thank you.
oh, he's really nice.
he's soft too.
is there anything you can tell her about the Christmas bear?
what?
can you tell her what he doesn't do, because he doesn't have
so what doesn't he do?
oh.
so what doesn't he do?
no more songs.
oh, he used to have songs in em, huh?
it scares her so she prefers the batteries out
it wasn't because the batteries ran down.
but she asked us to take the batteries out so he wouldn't sing.
she doesn't like that.
oh, he's nicer just quiet.
he's nice and quiet though, isn't he?
oh, there's bl in the, in the buggy.
you're right!
you know what he had on his feet last time I was here?
what?
he had big slippers with claws on the end.
say that again?
somehow that translated to Shalom was sitting on her
and I think it, the claws, she thought of the cat
I see.
I think that was it.
was Shalom reading your book?
honey, I put the book on your shelf.
can you come back in here, please?
I put the book on your shelf if you want your book.
you dropped it?
let me help.
can you pick them up?

very quickly.
can you go back in the other room now, please?
mhm.
is that only book you'd like?
that's the same book we looked at last time.
oh, this is the Noah book!
it's the same book.
you want to sit up here and we can look at the Noah book?
ok.
you must still like this book, huh?
here's another different one she
oh.
there's Noah.
once a very long time ago there lived a man called Noah.
and what's he doing?
yeah.
do you like grapes?
yeah, me too.
do you like green ones or purple ones?
you like both of them.
there, the very next morning Noah and his sons went to the cypress
there they are.
they're cutting down the trees.
and what are they doing?
do you know what they're doing?
what is this thing?
this long thing?
is that called a saw?
yeah.
and they're , they're cutting a tree with it, right?
and look what they did.
when they cut it all in pieces it looks like that.
it doesn't look like a tree anymore, does it?
it looks like boards.
yeah.
what are they doing there?
what are those, what are those women doing?
yeah, you remember some of the words.
look at that.
do you think they built that all by themselves?
look at that.
that's so big.
yeah.
and what goes in that boat?
yeah.
who, who goes in it?
some of the animals go in, right?
and some people?
let's see.
look what they're doing, they're filling the boat up with food too.
cause they're going on a long trip.
yeah.
look at these animals.
what kinds of animals are there?
two of everything, right?
what are these?
these two?
right.
you have two bears.
and what are those?
do you know what those are?
what?
right.
do you know what those are?
that's a hard kind of animal to know.
what is that?
these two?
very good.
I bet you don't know what those are.
what are those?
they have bumps on their back.
yeah.
they're called camels.
and lots of different kinds of birds.
I don't know what the birds are.
ok.
let's , let's go to the next page.
Noah opened the door of the ark and two by two the animals hurried .
when all had been done as God had ordered, Noah closed the door.
look at all those animals.
rain began to pour down.
creeks became rushing rivers.
rivers flowed into lakes.
lakes joined to make a great ocean.
and the ark was lifted off the land.
look at that.
there it goes.
I think they're all closed up inside so they don't get wet anymore.
you, you've been rained on?
did you get wet?
in all the world nothing was left but Noah, and his family, and the
look at that!
there's Noah and everybody on that big boat, all by themselves on
they're all inside there, nice and dry, eating, eating all the
what do you think they eat?
do they
the horses eat hay, right?
and maybe like
maybe the giraffes and some of those animals eat hay too.
what do you think the bears ate?
they eat hay too?
maybe they had to cause there wasn't a lot of other kinds of food.
maybe they ate grapes, cause, remember, Noah was picking grapes.
look at that.
they're all inside swimming around.
do you have a tissue?
I'm really.
coming in from outside.
thank you.
can I get you something warm to drink?
no, thanks, I'm all set.
look at that.
the ark was noisy and crowded.
and Noah and his family were kept very busy.
they brought food and water to the animals.
they swept the stalls and cleaned the cages.
look at that.
you know what that looks like?
it looks like a big zoo.
a zoo in a boat.
and there they are.
they're landing now.
they saw a bird.
the bird is finding some land.
now they're on land again.
they're still in there.
maybe it'll show us a picture of them coming out.
do you think it'll do that?
let's see.
ok, they're on land.
and Noah's looking up at the sky.
oh, there're the animals.
they're all going to come out.
yup, they're all
see?
the land is outside now.
it's all nice and dry, so they're all going to go right out there and
yeah.
I think that's
oop, there.
that's where they live now.
what are these two?
yeah.
they're all nice and pink.
ok, I'll , I'll read
ok, this is the last part, ok?
on that day a beautiful rainbow appeared and God spoke to Noah.
God has sent that rainbow as a promise said Noah.
he will never send another flood to wash the world away.
from now on whenever we see a rainbow in the sky we will remember.
see that rainbow?
Noah and his wife and sons and their wives built new homes and
in time the earth was filled with people once again.
look at that.
are they sleeping?
am I going to go home now?
not not yet.
not for a little while yet.
excuse me?
they're going to get rained again?
is that what you said?
that's what I heard.
what do you see?
did we have a Christmas tree this year?
I took my Christmas tree down too.
it was getting all dry, wasn't it?
yeah, I left mine up for a long time.
and then the needles started to come off and got on the floor.
so I took it outside.
yup.
but first I took all the, the shiny things off.
hmm.
there goes the truck.
mhm.
what did you have on your Christmas tree when it was up?
do you remember?
do you remember?
what?
yes, your toys are in the toy box.
do you remember what we hung on the Christmas tree?
maybe you can't remember.
it was in the other room?
can you show her where it was?
yeah.
show me where it was.
can you show her where the Christmas tree was?
you're a little rabbit.
ok, I can read a little bit of it, and then Mommy can read the rest.
is that good.
yeah, I, I knew that you'd want to be up.
ok.
this is a library book, right.
yeah.
once there was a little bunny who wanted to run away.
look at that!
there's the little bunny.
he's a rock.
yeah, he's a rock bunny.
yeah.
look!
there's his mom!
looking for the little bunny!

that's a nice story.
can you have mommy read you that one?
oh, can I read it?
where are you going?

we were in the middle of that one.
shall we read that one?
can you get the one about Edith?
what's this one?
ok, we can look at this one too.
we were in the middle of that one, so
oh, ok.
oh, look at that.
Christmas is coming.
said Edith
why don't you have Mommy read to you for a little while?
I want to hear Mommy read to you.
will you sit in my lap?
so what did Edith do?
I told you so.
that's what he said.
Edith's favorite present was a hood of real fur.
mhm.
and she had an idea.
you had an idea?
what was your idea?
oh, that's a phrase you like to say a lot, isn't it?
you mean, what mufflers.
exclaimed Charles.
we'll think of you every time we wear them.
well, I think the one with the glasses is Charles.
see his glasses?
I think that's Charles.
mhm.
the end.
that was a nice story.
I liked that.
I think we've read enough.
want to do something else now?
you just heard this story.
you want to hear it again?
you're a funny bunny.
should we start at the beginning?
ok.
Christmas is coming, said Edith.
so Edith stopped crying, and thought instead.
she had an idea.
what?
is that my coat?
mhm.

where's your coat?
oh, we're going to read some more?
here, why don't you come back up?

quickly?
oh, remember what you made last time when I was here?
a purple and blue candy cane.

yes, you just it.
Observer.
mhm.
can you tell her what your name is?
mhm.
hey, that looks good!
should I make a candy cane on the same paper?
ok.
this isn't a good example here
over here.
can we eat it?
it would taste like crayon and paper though.
there.
here, I don't think you should draw on top of this book, cause if
do you like to color?
what are you making now?
are you making something different?
what are you making now?
a candy cane.
that's the same.
that's not different.

would you pet her?
and usually unsupervised is when it really happens, so
sometimes it's Child being mean, and sometimes it's Shalom being
what are you looking for in there?
I think it's empty.
she said it's empty.
that means there's nothing in it, right?
well, do you see anything?
oh, I know what's in there.
it's not very interesting though.
do you know what this is?
this is, I can put it on my tape recorder when my tape recorder runs
but the tape recorder doesn't need it now.
so can I put it back in the bag?
no?
say yes .
I think that's a good place for it.
I'm going to wind it all up so it doesn't come unraveled.

are you a mountain?
yes, Child?
how's it doing?
okay, come here in the light where I can see it.

this is just so that it doesn't get dirty.
and then later on daddy can look at it.
okay?
daddy is getting dinner.
you know what?
it might be a splinter.
but we'll have to look at it later.
okay, now you have to promise mommy one thing.

we have to find homes for the puppies.
ask Investigator if she would like a puppy.
I would love a puppy but I don't have room for a puppy.
I knew that was going to be the answer.
everybody says that.
what's that?
what is that, Child?
a big big toy.
it's a little toy but what is it?
well, if it starts beating me up, I'm not going to let it, no.
is it using me?
as a mountain?

I think.
what happened to the batteries, Child?
he has to have magic power, I think.

they just don't work.
ok, in they go.
oops, I think this one has to go in this way.
there.
oh, I made a mistake.
ok, sorry.
are you sure it goes like that?
how come it's not closing then?
I should take em out?
what if I try turning
oh, maybe you were right.
maybe it does go this way.
oh, I think that'll do it.
there.
there.
bravo.
I don't think they work.
I think you need different batteries in there.
because sometimes we put the lights on and then we forget to turn
the wheels work good.
yeah.
what?
how many wheels are there?
where's five?
one two three four five six.
maybe we should give the porcupine a ride.

he's got those sticky things on em.
we never saw a porcupine before, did we?

he's like Dumbo flying through the air, isn't he?
there.
did you see the Dumbo movie?

did we read about Dumbo in your book?
poor Dumbo cries, didn't he?
why did he cry?
did everyone make fun of Dumbo?

that's a pogo stick.
yeah, you put your feet on here and you hold on here and then you
it's fun.
yeah.
maybe in a few years.
I think you're a little too small for that.
but it is fun.
mommy used to like to play on that.
we had one of those.
we liked it.
did you have that?
no, I remember going to people's house that had em and I thought
but I never had one.
oh, you were deprived.
yes.
I had stilts though.
stilts.
we didn't have those.
our nextdoor neighbor did.
I loved stilts.
yeah, those were great.
these are stilts.
right.
you walk on those and then you can be high.
like the man at the circus.
did Child tell you we went to the circus on Saturday?
did you go to the circus?
did you?
did you go up real high?
tell Investigator what else you saw at the circus.
what did we see?
lions, right.
what else?
no, we didn't see any dinosaurs.
you have dinosaurs on your tummy.

you know.
what are those?
the track.
that's the coal car.
you know.
what is it?
right.
that looks like a race car.
what's this?
right.
oh and then he's going to pick that up in the air?
oh, that's a good idea.
oh boy.
so all the things on the page are going to be hooked together.
and then the crane is going to take it way up in the air?
oh, I can't wait to see that.
that sounds exciting, doesn't it?
what are all of these things?
what's that?
yes.
that's a little village, looks like.
there's a barn.
oh, those are all things that we have in the house.
do you know what all these things are?
right.
what's that?
right.
what's this?
is it going round, and
well, after it listens to us for a while and I'm going to take it back
huh?
hi.
what's what?
these?
I think Child has an obsession with feet.
see that?
I got a foot booboo.
oh.
I kicked the steps and I got a bruise on my toe.
that was dumb, right?
I thought so.
thanks a lot.
let me see.
your feet are all covered up.
this isn't fair.
can you show Investigator your toes?
he's so funny about his feet.
he never wants to have his feet exposed.
really?
like the minute I remove his dirty socks, I have to put on clean
he never wants to go barefoot.
that's amazing.
I know.
I don't know why.
and he willn't let me cut his toe nails.
you have special feet in there, right?
you're keeping them
sacred.
yes.
where are these shoes from?
I don't remember.
some store.
what are those called, Child?
what did Mommy tell you shoes like that are called?
sandals.
right.
do you have any sandals?
no?
cause you don't like to have your toes exposed.
someone gave him a pair and he wouldn't wear them.
he like cried the whole time he had them on.
that's really interesting.
what?
you have little boats on your socks.
yesterday, what?
what were you going to say about yesterday?
did you play under the sprinkler yesterday with the hose?
you want to spray on Margot.
oh.
did she like that?
did she?
I bet cha she got mad.
no?
she didn't get mad?
you played on the carpet?
you sprayed on the carpet?
no, you didn't .
he wanted to.
I see.
he has an active imagination.
right.
we didn't even see Margot yesterday.
who's out there?
where are those children from?
oh.
can you tie your shoe?
alright.
show me how.
right.
that's plastic on there so you can put it through the holes.
you know there's a name for those things.
I can't remember what they're called.
is there really?
yeah, I saw on tv or read about it.
I said to myself.
I'm going to remember what those things are called.
it's the kind of thing they'd ask on a game show.
right, it was.
it's something like Niglet or something.
really?
yeah, something like that.
so come on, Child.
do you want to look at some more of these pictures?
no?
you're bored with this.
ok.
you're busy with your shoes now.
alright.
oh, I could get the rest of the toys out.
I forgot I had other toys.
ah.
what's that?
ah.
ah.
who's that?
do you remember the name of that guy?
what?
what is it?
what's he called?
what is he called with these pricky things on em?
is that a porcupine?
oh, look what Investigator has.
remember what this is?
what?
what is that?
he's jumping on your foot, helping you remember.
does he say woof woof?
oh, he crashed.
oh oh.
oh oh.
you better get em out of there.
are you from the department of psychology?
yeah.
oh.
well, actually I'm in psychology and linguistics.
oh really.
yeah.
oh.
there it goes.
crash crash.
oh.
what a great coffee table.
it was my creation.
it's an old sewing machine.
yeah, it's neat.
thanks.
I'm sure it provides hours of enjoyment for Child too.
he loves it.
I think it's stuck.
now what.
yay.
you're going to go the other way?
ok.
oh, that's like a tunnel, isn't it?
oh, is that the Duffy school back there?
yeah.
oh, I see.
I think they work with the U of R too.
do they?
the psychology department because they do counseling of students.
right.
that's probably right.
it's nice having that playground.
mhm.
do you play on it sometimes when those kids aren't there?
yes.
oh, are you ok?
youch.
can you tell Investigator which what rides you go on at the play?
what do you ride on?
and what else?
the swings.
what else?
the horse?
the bunny and the bumblebee?
yeah.
it says bumble bumble?
you're funny, Child.
yeah.
what is this study studying?
oh, I'm interested in how parents and children talk.
and I'm mostly interested in, um, do you, like, does he imitate you.
that kind of thing.
oh.
I'm interested in the language aspects.
yeah, he repeats everything.
I think he's stuck.
I don't think he can fit in there.
it looks a little too small.
he could go through that tunnel again.
that's another kind of tunnel.
that's a tunnel too.
lots of tunnels there.
that's a little tiny tunnel.
mhm.
no, I don't think he can fit, do you?
that's the axle of the wheels.
where's the motor?
oh.
yeah, that's like a hill.
you keep bumping your head.
poor guy.
are you going to lie down?
probably that's a good idea.
keep you head out of the way.
where's Child?
oh, there, I see his eye.
do you see Investigator over there?
oh, they must be hiding.
they're in their garage.
right.
they can see you?
can you see them?
watch your head.
oh, that's a tunnel under there too?
oh, I thought that was the garage.
oh boy.
watch your head.
watch out.
oh.
what do those trucks make?
in that red part on the back?
what do they mix up in there?
yeah.
you know.
what are they called?
cement mixer.
right.
that's where they mix the cement in that back part.
and then they dump it out to make sidewalks.
mhm.
that's a wheelbarrow?
oh.
that's right.
and then they take the wheelbarrow full of cement and pour it.
did you ever see anyone do that?
that's the garage?
I have to get Simon.
I can see him winding up here.
ok.
here comes Simon.
what is that?
that's a collie dog, remember?
and you know what?
last time you named him Wolfie.
right.
that's right.
remember Wolfie?
yeah, I know.
but Wolfie wasn't a dog, was he?
what was Wolfie?
maybe that's why he wants to keep his toes covered.
maybe.
no, this was before that.
this all started a long time ago.
that would convince me to keep my toes covered.
um, what kind of an animal was Wolfie?
was he a dog?
no.
what was he?
what was Wolfie?
did he fly?
didn't he have
what color was he?
tell Investigator what he looked like.
was he green?
you know.
don't open it.
I think there's stuff you don't want to touch in there.
no, that's
what is that?
it's the fireplace.
you know, Child.
these are all things you know you're not allowed to touch.
that's the poker.
the poker.
well, let me see which one you're pointing to.
is that the broom?
then why do you ask me?
Simon has really black hair.
I know.
he had a lot more.
he's lost a lot.
that's the poker.
 and the other one is called the shovel.
no, that's the poker.
that's the poker.
you'd better put that back there, kiddo.
put that right back, Child Ralphy.
we poke the logs around to make the fire go better.
let me see.
that's the broom.
to sweep the ashes away.
that's the shovel.
that's to shovel all of the ashes into a bag and throw it away.
now why don't you come over here and not touch that anymore.
you know what it is.
why don't you come over and say hello to Simon.
yeah.
Simon wants to say hello to you.
you know what that is.
come on over.
Simon's looking for you.
no, you can't bang on there.
I don't think that's a good thing to bang on.
no, it's not.
Child, please, stop that now.
Investigator doesn't like it when you do things like that.
I don't , I don't like it.
it's too noisy for me.
yeah.
what are those?
that's the old porcupine.
mhm.
I don't know.
you're Mr Curious today.
Mr Curious.
are you Curious George?
do I want to go to the zoo?
this afternoon?
well, I'd love to but I really can't .
I have to get back to school.
Investigator goes to school too, Child.
are you a graduate student?
actually I just finished my Phd.
oh, you did?
congratulations.
yeah.
thanks.
I'm just here for another month and I'm going down to City.
I took a postdoc in City.
oh, that's great.
what?
I don't understand.
do you want me to tie your sneaker though?
ok.
I'd be happy to do it.
should I do it?
why don't you let Investigator do it?
let me see if I can do it.
sometimes I have a hard time and I want to see if I know how.
should I try?
ok.
I'm making the loops.
ok.
did I do it right, you think?
does that look like
I think that's it, right?
that looks good.
it looks kind a like the other one.
should I put a knot in it?
ok, that's a good idea.
then it'll look just like the other one.
it'll have a fat knot in the middle.
there, now they look just alike.
pretty good, huh?
see, that ones's got a knot and that one's got one too.
so you want to go to the zoo today, Child?
is that the idea?
was that a hint?
what would you see if you went to the zoo?
what would you go and look at?
what about the monkeys?
I love the monkeys.
what?
what?
you want to come on the what?
on the platform?
what platform?
oh, you mean where the elephant was?
they had a platform and you could climb up on the elephant.
oh.
but we didn't let Child do that.
probably a good idea.
because he never would've gotten
you know what that book's about.
you've seen that book.
oh, what's that?
wait, I just saw something that we just talked about last night.
what's that?
is that the castle?
who lives in the castle?
who did Mommy tell you?
the king and queen?
they live in the castle.
remember?
in that other book that we have it showed the picture of the king.
and what do they wear on their heads?
remember, they had those pointy things?
what were those called?
crowns.
you want to want to wear a crown?
and you could be King Child?
he thinks he is already.
that's Investigator's book.
don't bend it like that.
that's not nice.
what did Mom tell you about books?
books are like friends.
you should treat them nicely.
yes.
do you want to go?
do you have any books you want to show me?
you want to show Investigator your books?
oh, the ginger bread man.
oh, I remember.
no, I saw that someplace else.
he was afraid of it so I hid it.
oh, I know.
Margot has the Ginger Bread Man because I had to read it to her, the
really?
what?
there's a cow.
yeah.
the ginger bread man got a little ride on the cow?
or no, he didn't get a ride on the cow, he just saw the cow.
what did the ginger bread man say to the cow?
run, run as fast as you can.
you can't catch me.
I'm the ginger bread man.
yup, he went to the cow.
I was afraid of that book too, I think.
because at the end the fox eats the ginger bread man.
I know.
no, really a lot of those books are like that.
the three little pigs and
I know.
Little Red Riding Hood.
the Grimm's fairy tales are really awful.
I know, they are.
they're frightening.
there are several books that he has that he's really afraid of, so
what other books do you have?
there's a monster in a Grover book.
oh.
I want to take the monster out.
what, tell Investigator what books you like though.
what books do you have that you like?
a Grover book?
who's , tell her about the book that we have that's about a little
what's his name?
there's a monster in the book?
yeah?
Grover says?
was Grover afraid?
you're afraid too?
Grover closed his eyes?
tell her about the book about the monkey.
what's that monkey's name?
remember?
is it Curious George?
Curious George.
which Curious George book do you have?
is it going round and round or has it stopped?
I think it's still going round and round.
that's the microphone.
say boo in it.
yeah, you can say boo.
yup, you can say boo.
oh, look and when you do that you can make the things fall off.
right.
oh, boy, this is a great coffee table.

he puts cars on there.
yup, you already did.
you want to go.
last time I was here you know what you did?
you got your fire engine to show me.
do you want to show me that again or do you want to show me another?
go and show Investigator some of your toys.
what are you looking at out there?
do you see smoke?
and the kids.
do you want to show Investigator some of your toys that you like?
ok.
let's go to the zoo?
you are obsessed with the zoo today.
let's go.
alright.
I can't .
I wish I could.
I would love to go to the zoo and smell the animals.
she has to work.
I know, that's what I was thinking.
on a day like today can you imagine the odor there?
it's hot and yucky, uh.
it's awful anyway.
well, we're not going today, honey.
maybe you'll go another time.
we'll go another day.
and you can look at the monkeys for me, cause I love the monkeys.
and you know what else I like?
the seals.
oh, Child likes those.
I love the seals.
they swim and they look so happy.
what else is at the zoo?
there are lions.

elephants.
I like the elephants.
I like it when they put their trunk in water and then they spray it.
ah.
did you ever see that?
that's great.
Babar?
they spray Babar, don't they?
Babar, is that how you say it?
I don't know.

and what's Babar's son's name?
he has the same name as you, doesn't he?
what's his name?
what's your name?
oh, you sprayed on Mommy and Babar?
I think that was the highlight of Child's summer, when he
you liked that, didn't you?
let's go.
hey, let's just jump in the car and go to the zoo.
they're so funny, aren't they?
as soon as you say something it's like ok, let's do it right now.
they have no concept of time.
and schedules.
no, we're not going today, Child.
maybe you'll go some other time.
we might go tomorrow.
well.
is there still Lolly Pop farm?
is that still
yeah, I haven't been there though.
I haven't been since I was a kid.
we don't have any lolly pops.
Child, you are so funny.

we don't have any.
where are they?
don't , hey!
hey.
do you want to go to your bedroom?
then stop it.
don't be mean now.
what did Mom tell you about that?
don't ever hit Mom.
say you're sorry now.
you're being mean now.
I don't think you're funny at all.
good.
why don't you go and get a truck now and show Investigator.
go get me a truck.
I want to see a truck.
you don't want to see a truck?
she'll go with you.
you want to show her your toys upstairs?
should I come with you?
so should we take the barrels out first?
let's take the barrels out cause then they can get down in there.
ok.
put em in.
well, you have to stand em up cause they have to look out.
they're , they want  to have a nice view.
there.
hey, this is like the story of the happy man with his dump truck.
now can you give them all a ride?
ok, off they go.
bye, guys.
bye.

Child is going to take you for a nice ride.
you're going to hide?

yeah, I'm going to see them tomorrow morning.
oh, he's a riot.
great.
he's funny.
it's so interesting that they have such distinct
oh yeah.
it's amazing.
I know, I was surprised too.
you think of them as generic at this age but they're really all
what's the story here?
are you feeling a little aggressive?
I think so.
yeah?
you certainly did move them.
what's this thing?
is this part of Leggos or something?
mhm, Duplo.
Duplo.
it's Leggos for little children.
are those good?
did you offer Investigator any raisins?
she didn't want any?
no.
I don't blame you.
he's probably touched all of them.
so you want to go get me a book now or do you want to pull the wagon?
you know, I came to visit you and you have to entertain me.
yeah, like Mommy has to entertain you all the time.
now you have to entertain Investigator.
yup, it's a big responsibility.
what are you doing, drying the raisins in the sun?
giving your raisins a ride?
oh, that's good.
bye, raisins.
when is Child's birthday?
um, January twentieth, eighty five.
oh, right.
I think I already asked you that.
I'll write it down.
what?
no, she's not coloring, honey.
she's writing.
I just wrote down when your birthday is.
do you know when it is?
when is it?
I don't think he knows.
do you know?
very good.
very good, Child.
I don't remember telling you that.
do you know how old you are?
how old are you?
tell Investigator how old you are.
are you a hundred?
oh.
you're a hundred?
oh, my goodness, you look young for your age.
are you three?
are you one?
oh, you're not one cause you're two.
that's good.
that says five hundred words to grow on.
I think we had a little raisin spill over there.
can you pick all of those up, please?
there's some right there.
that's good.
oh, you know, I don't know if that's a half hour tape.
no, it's a
this session is an hour anyway but it's forty five minutes on a
oh, oh.
are those yummy?
what's happened there?
who did that?
who bent the book like that?
what was that boy's name?
some little boy did that.
I don't know who did it.
was it Simon?
oh, you.
yes and then it looks fine, doesn't it?
is the mail man here?
I think he was coming when I was pulling in the driveway.
oh.
I saw the mail truck.
oh.
Simon is losing hair at a rapid rate.
that's funny.
every time I touch em I get hair all over me.
you poor guy, you're going To be a baldy.
oh.
well, why don't you give those animals a ride?
what about that horse and the collie?
they might want a ride.
what is that horse's name?
what's his name?
his name is donkey?
and what's the dog's name?
hmm?
is it Lassie?
what about the porcupine and duck?
they might want a ride too.
this is like the happy man with his dump truck.
what happened in that story?
he had a truck?
right.
and who went in the dump truck?
all the animals, didn't they?
and then what did he do?
he gave them a ride.
oh, poor Simon.
and what happened when he tipped up the dumper?
what did the animals say?
they said.
wee, this is fun, this is like a sliding board.
I think everybody's in there now.
oop, they dumped a little.
oh oh, everyone fell out.
yup, they're all on the floor.
do you go to school, Child?
he wants to go to nursery school.
yeah?
in September.
oh.
where're you going to go?
where?
I see the horse.
where is he?
I think the horse is a little too close to the fire place.
oh, better go get em before he gets burned.
see em?
go get em.
no, don't turn that.
this is a funny tape recorder because you can't listen to it unless
oh.
it doesn't have a speaker in it.
can you tell Investigator what things we saw at the nursery school?
what'd you see?
what did they have there?
mmm.
wow, it sounds like fun.
are you
does it look like Wolfie?
ah, it does, doesn't it?
only he willn't peck your sneakers.
did he?
don't touch that, please, Child.
Child, please, don't touch that.
no, don't touch it cause it willn't make any noise anyway.
yeah, it's a machine.
is that what you said?
you want green?
what do you want?
something green in there?
where's the green thing?
there's a green hole there, right?
the green hole is where I put my headphones in but I don't have the
the headphones are like ear muffs and they go over your ears and I
yes.
yes, yes.
so what else?
tell Investigator more about nursery school.
well, we're not going till the end of the summer.
you can go outside pretty soon cause I'm going to go home.
then we'll go outside, ok?
and you can play in your sandbox.
oh, that'll be fun.
ok.
don't want to get it dirty?
you're going to get water in your sand box?
yeah.
no?
ok.
look what Investigator did with the barrels.
shall we make it fall?
ah.
hey, watch it, Bud.
don't hurt Investigator.
I see you knocked those down.
be careful now.
don't hurt her.
ok.
wait till I'm done though.
I want to get my hand out of the way before the destruction comes.
ok.
ok.
there you go, Child.
knock it down.
boom.
that was one shot and they all went down.
alright.
remember though, wait till I'm all done.
ok.
yeah, that devilish laugh of Child.
you think that's funny.
ok.
there they are.
oh, they fell over all by themselves that time.
the dinosaur belt.
the mighty dinosaur belt.
there they go.
we could go bowling.
look, we can see if we can knock em down with the other one.
hey.
do you want to do that?
oh.
you would rather use your dinosaur belt.
hey.
are you trying to hurt Investigator?
that's not nice, Child.
ok.
so what's , Child, what's Simon?
is he your, is he your father?
yo, Child.
Child, Investigator is asking you a question.
what's Simon?
is he your father?
what is he?
is he your sister?
what is he?
what is he though?
he's Simon?
but what is he?
he's your little
what?
you know.
no but what is he?
and you're his big
right.
and he's your little
don't swing that belt around, please.
do I have to take it from you?
then please stop it.
if you do it again Mom's going to take it.
yeah, I think that's not a good thing to do.
cause it's stretchy and when you let go it springs back and it
it hits your face.
and then you would cry.
so it's not a good thing to do.
yeah and if you hit me I'd really cry.
I'd cry so much.
ah.
Child!
maybe you should put it back on.
yeah, why don't you put it on?
cause I think it looked nicer with it on.
I did too.
it was a real fashion statement.
what did I say about swinging that?
alright, I'm taking it.
there it goes.
no.
can you hold it nicely or put it around your waist?
then do it.
not your wrist, your waist.
this is your waist.
around your belly.
put it on.
let's put the buckle in the front.
are you trying to buckle it in the back?
you want me to do it?
alright.
yeah, I think that's a good idea.
it looks like you're chasing your tail.
I know.
now don't take it off again or I'm going to take it away.
I'm going to put it upstairs in your drawer.
oh oh.
ok, give it to me.
yes, you've had enough warnings.
yes.
see what happens?
then give it to me.
then put it on your waist and don't remove it again.
let me see the belt.
oh.
I'm going to have to get ready to go home pretty soon.
do you want to help me put my toys away?
ok.
where are they all?
you have em down there in your little wagon, I think.
oh, here's the wagon with all the toys.
and don't forget the horse by the fireplace.
yup, don't forget my horse.
thank you.
there he is, all warm.
there goes the duck.
there goes the elephant.
is that everybody?
was that all?
oh, what about those trucks, those cement mixers?
where are those?
he was probably trying to hide those.
oh, the zebra.
oh and the zebra.
I forgot all about him.
he'll be sad.
he would be all alone.
thank you.
thank you.
what about the book?
can you fit that in there too?
bombs away.
ok.
now.
that's going to help me remember when I go home, so I can remember

it doesn't have what?
no.
I have that.
at the zoo?
oh.
did you see one of these too?

I think it's either a dog or a wolf.
I think it's a dog.
it's a collie dog.
do you think it's a dog?
yeah?
ok.
did you see one of those at the zoo?
you were going.

he's squeaking on your head.
you do yukyuk?
would you like to build blocks?
well, pick up the porcupine.
ok, you can put em where you want.
oh, you have a special place to put blocks.
this is well worth its weight in gold.
these winters are so long.
I was telling my husband that my Lego skills are improving and it's
Child, you want to get the blocks for me?
let's do Legos.
I like Legos.
yeah.
they all live in there, huh?
oh boy, do you have a lot of them?
here they come.

oh, good.
and maybe that's door.
I don't know.
I can't tell.
now these little ones only fit on the ones that have open spaces.
they willn't fit on the other ones.
I see.
that's the difference between Legos and Duplos.
they fit on these.
mhm.
does it go on there?
well, let's try this one.
like this?
well, it willn't go on that way.
you have to turn it around the other way.

should we do that?
ok, let's see if we can do that.
oh, the girl's going to be on tv.
maybe.
I think the girl's going to have to stand on this thing and have the tv be someplace else.
there.
can this be the tv?
can this be the tv set?
I don't know how to do this.
oh, I've got it.

what do they have on them?
do you see numbers?
what do you do with twentysided dice?
they've got two sevens!
yeah, it goes one to ten and no, zero to nine, zero to nine.
they roll.
you try it.
you pick them up and put them down.
like, like this.
now what were you going to do?
what did you do?
okay, you go get them.
look.
maybe not.
can we see those, Child?
Investigator is explaining them to me.
what, darling?
no.
no but I have this.
what's that?
is that another one?
a little different.
you know what else I have?
oh.
I have, if I can find it, what's this?
oh, boy.
oh, boy.
that's great.
what?
do I have another one of those?
I might.
what color is that?
brown?
that's not brown, what color is that?
right.
what color is that?
no, that's not brown either.
what color is this?
how come this isn't red?
I think it's a matter of uh, discrimination.
I think this one is not quite clean enough.
well, it's , it's certainly a brownish red.
maybe we should have some more light?
should we turn a light on?
oh.
yeah?
how about this light?
oh!
Child?
you see this dice here?
can you give me one with the same color as that?
which one?
is there another one the same color as this one?
you'll try to find one?
not the same size.
no, I, I think it's completely beyond.
I don't think.
do I need that one?
yeah, I do need that one.
aren't those nice?
those are really something!
do I have another one?
let's see.
let's see what I have.
it should be in here someplace.
you know what, look at that.
a pencil.
oh!
you did, look!
did he have another one?
how many are there?
how many are there?
how many?
how many?
oops!
they're very easy to lose.
yeah.
did you see where it went?
do you want to get up, Child?
stand up so we can see where it went.
got it.
okay.
they're actually not that easy to lose, especially if they're red.
do you think I might have another one?
why do you think that?
how many?
how many are there now?
how many is that?
and that?
and that?
and that?
how many is that?
that's three.
how many is this one too?
and how many are there all together?
how many are there all together?
how many red ones?
how many black ones?
how much is two plus two?
where?
I don't know.
I can't see.
how many is there?
how many?
those are doing something, aren't they, Child?
no, no, no.
be careful because we don't want to lose them.
these are very special to us.
turns out Investigator had more toys that he wasn't letting on.
was he holding out on us?
well, if those aren't toys I don't know what is.
I guess.
okay.
no, I don't .
no, I don't .
like this.
it's the same shape, right?
is it the same size?
what are you checking?
what are you try?
uhhuh.
is it?
oh.
do they have the same numbers on them?
no?
is this the same as this?
how are they different?
how come it's different?
oh, Child, I think this is very exciting.
you know what we can use these as?
we should, they are.
what am I pretending they are?
building a tower with them.
what do you build a tower with?
what did I pretend that was?
should I put this one here?
will it balance?
no.
no.
or we could do it this way.
what am I doing?
do you want to try that?
now what are you doing?
oh.
what are you doing, Child?
are you playing with blocks?
beads!
where's the other one?
we're missing one.
do you have one in your hand?
no, it's still there.
okay.
I think it's very hard to do, isn't it, honey?
another one of what?
of the brown ones?
no.
but you know what you can put?
you know what you could do?
you could put that one there.
what are you going to do there?
now why didn't that work?
it was so what?
so big?
which one was so big?
mhm.
so big you couldn't put it on top?
you were too big?
are you big now?
I think so.
are you dirty?
you are a little dirty.
shall we, let me just skritch it off.
probably a little bit of paste.
were you pasting something in school today?
or it could be a little yogurt.
did you have yogurt for lunch?
looks like paste.
there.
Child, now what are you doing?
now what are you doing?
is that silly talk?
you know who else Investigator goes to play with?
if you don't play with me Investigator will play with you?
uhhuh.
do you know who else Investigator goes and plays with?
who?
what's not there?
what's not there?
is something missing?
did something go away?
what?
what?
do you think it's the thing that's missing?
you don't remember what.
how many just fell?
there.
were they in your hand?
is that why you did that?
no, we found it.
yes, we were trying to find them.
why?
because they're Investigator's toy and he does't want to lose them.
do you like to lose your toys?
can you speak up?
she goes to.
tell me loud so I can hear.
yeah.
where does the water come from?
from the faucet that she turned on?
and she forgot to turn it off?
now what's this story?
here comes a chicken.
and the chicken sees a great big egg.
and the chicken sits on the egg.
then what happens?
right.
did we see a chicken today?
where?
where?
you don't know?
was it at the museum, remember?
did we see some little tiny chickens trying to come out of some
remember that, honey?
you didn't ?
oh, I showed them to you.
what else did we see at the museum?
we saw, we read this whole book now I think.
oh, no, we still have this piece, this one.
going to do that?
what happens?
she gets out and that mashes the pie in his face.
that's the end of that book.
I'll bet Investigator brought his toys.
shall we
what were you doing when you did it?
Child, tell Investigator, did we go to the museum today?
what did we see at the museum?
what did we see?
did we see anything?
a dinosaur?
what did we do anything with the dinosaur?
what?
did we make him roar?
how did we make him roar?
you don't know what made him roar?
did it involve a nickel?
what did we do?
make him roar like a nickel!
let's look at Investigator's toys.
now what are those, Child?
why are you whispering?
what would you like to play with?
shall we play with your dollhouse and your farm?
shall we do that?
or let's see, what else can we play with?
what do you want?
what we can do with them.
then what?
why don't you tell us?

is that roof going to go on?
now what does that mean, Child?
there, you did it!

yeah, Investigator doesn't know how to play with those toys.
we could do all kinds of things with the baby.
now which one is the mommy and which one is the daddy and which one
does the baby push the mommy in the stroller?
what happens to the baby now?
why shouldn't I?
not?
look what's over there.

one more page of pictures and that's all.
oh!
Child!
this will interest Investigator!
do you know who this person is?

sand is much smaller than that.
it looks a little like sand but that's your cousin Investigator.
sand, that's sand.

just a lot?
can you count all those beads?
you need to unbuckle it?
well, that's not the one you unbuckle.
do you want me to unbuckle it for you?
you unbuckle the top one.
you leave that one buckled.
because you can still put it on.
but that's the wrong foot.
let's see if you can take it out.
no, the other way.
pull it the other way.
nah.
that way will never come out.
yes, that one.
okay, you started it and I'll finish it.

the second one shouldn't last more than an hour, at
it's not an hour and a half.
there's your tape recorder.

I think an hour and a half is a little bit too long for kids to

what tape do you have in there?
what is it?
Robinhood?
did you bring something?
oh, uh, I didn't bring a pen.

this is Robinhood and this is Wizard of Oz.
which side did you want?
Robinhood?
it's already started, you know.
why don't you get the book that goes with it?
so you can look at the pictures?
I think we turned it down too low.
shall I stop it while you're gone?
is there something in particular that you want us to do?
not really.
um, I brought some toys that we can play with or something.
um, they're not real exciting toys, unfortunately I have to go to
um but just you know normal talking and whatever and don't

but I've seen, I've seen Andrew and Taylor also.

wow, you know which picture, which book goes with which tape.
that's pretty smart.
alright, you want it on?
okay, start at the beginning.

wait.
okay, here, this is where it starts, Dorothy and her little dog.
wait till the chime rings.
there it is.

no, that's the stop button.
which is the play button?
that's right.
shall I press it?
I'm turning.
no, these guys are nice.
these are Dorothy's friends.
it's hard to be patient, isn't it?
right.
ah, let's not switch back and forth.
maybe you don't really want to listen to tapes.
would you like to do something else?
on the what?
in the trash.
do you want to build something with the building blocks?
I'll help you.

we skipped a ring though, Child, this is the page we're on.
the birds part is where we're at right now.
well, wait, it's going to ring in a minute.

um hmm.
it's going to ring in just a minute.
well, the witch is all melted.
that witch is all melted now.

Dorothy threw water on her and it made her melt.
I don't know.
Toto.

why don't you put the tapes and the books away and we'll do
you want to see what Observer has in the bag?
if she has anything interesting?
there's toys in here.
look inside, see if there's anything.
want to take a look?
let's see, I don't know.
do you like trucks or not?
oh, that's a nice one.
and here's some animals.
you can look inside the other one.

want me to help you?
oh, that's not easy to do.
oops, that's happened before, don't worry about it.
there, it opened!
it fell off.
all the way.
there.
who do we know that has a station wagon?
who do we know that has a station wagon car?
yeah, I'm trying to fix it so it doesn't fall off, hold on a second.
do you know what kind of a truck that is?
oops, it's a lost cause.
it's hard to fix.
sure.
it turns around like that.
that's a cement mixer, Child.
does he have one like that?
it is?
I didn't know he had one.
he does, he has a station wagon too?
now it willn't close.
I don't know.
it's a broken car.
the bottom part?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.
nope.
I don't know, why don't you check the bag and see?
books?
what books, are they books that we have or are they different?
go ahead, look.
it's a word book, Child.
what are those?
animals?
a giraffe.
he has a Do_You_Know book that has a giraffe in it, that's right.
that's sort of like his Do_You_Know book.
a book with lots of pictures and things, isn't it?
that's right.
yeah, you want to get them out, show the horses to each other?
that horse could be the little baby horse.
that's even smaller, that that one, isn't it?
very little.
now we have three horses.
and they what?
they melted?
oh.
did someone throw water on them?
remember, we took them in the bathtub and they didn't melt, did
was red soap melted in the bathtub?
it did?
oh, too bad.
let me wipe your chin now, I think your chin's all wet.
cause you're talking silly.
that's the tiny baby horse, the medium baby horse, and the momma

that is a momma cow.
your chin is going to melt, witch.
I want to see some pictures in this book and see if there are any
what things do you see that you know?
what's that?
there's a cake in this Do_You_Know book?
a dinosaur, oh, we know somebody who likes dinosaurs, don't we?
those are all the colors.
do you know your colors?
you know lots of colors.
very good.
this is about clothes that you wear.
I don't see any diapers, this must be a big girl book.
do you wear diapers?
that's right, you do.
but soon you'll wear underpants.
look, there's underpants right there, pink ones.
Andreas wears white ones?
yeah, he does.
what is that thing?

you see the little, the little place there, the little hole where
like Andreas' duck bank.

hmm?
no, no, that's something else.
udder.
that's where milk comes out, right, for the baby cows and for us too
stop drinking the cow.
people don't drink out of that part, baby cows do.
how do you drink your milk?
is that a baby cow?
it is?
I don't think so.
that's a baby cow.
he can drink out of this cow.
whoops.
like that.
there.
well, he was too tall otherwise.
do you think mother cows give their, do you
I don't know, you can try.
that's a very heavy block.
he willn't rip those.
try it this way, try it on the wide side.
that's a little better, isn't it?
there, he did it.
he did it.
very good.
okay, find some more animals.
what other animals do you see?
um hmm, little puppies.

you willn't get lost.
do you remember the number?
blow.
blow.
good job.
good job, good job.
oh, I know, that's kind of a broken thing.
oh, here's a page with all sorts of birds.
now why did they put the spider on the animal page instead of on the
that's a good question.
can you fix it?
I don't think I can, Child.
I think it's a goner.
it has to go to the car hospital.
do you think we should send this car to George's garage?
or the junk yard.
a toy car, George doesn't fix toy cars?
he gives toy cars though, remember one day we went there and he gave
I remember.
do you want, you want Joyce to give you that, do you mean Observer?
or are you talking about Joyce?
oh, George to give you that.
George gave you a toy car.
can't fix it, Observer will have to take
good morning, this is Child Lastname and Parent Lastname and we are
it is Saturday, February twenty two.
and both Observer and Investigator are taping.
is that enough for right now or do you want more?
here we go.
what does it look like?
can you build a farm with it?
oh, new toys, huh, Child.
you used to have one of those when you were a baby.
do you remember?
a hedgehog?
you used to chew on it.
oh, okay.
what did, what did Observer bring with her today?
what things?
what does that look like?
a what?
a what?
a Waffelo?
is that what you called it?
can I braid your hair while you play with it?
since we didn't get around to braiding today?
she had braids in her hair last time.
she had lots of braids last time.
this guy squeaks too.
whoops.
what's the other one?
a wappeloc, huh?
when Andreas was a little, little baby, we brought him to the store.
not one of those, no.
just the other two.
and when you came out, and you were a baby, and you played
until they just got too old and too dirty from too many children
threw them away.
we threw them away, that's right.
okay, ready?
here comes the rubber band.
oh, boy.
looks like you have a very unhappy brother, Child.
Sister.
oh, oops.
sorry.
bet we can get those horses over there and that horse and we can.
remember the last time we had baby horses and everything?
yes, she does.
I'm going to do this side now, okay?
oops.
why do you like all the horses to lie down?
standing farm.
she likes them lying down.
sleeping animals.
okay, we'll do the other braid now.
mushy.
pop goes the weasel.
oops.
you know, I babysat a kid and uh, he had one of these too, he
oh, really.
the trouble is if you take those in the bathtub they get filled up.
do they still squeak when there water in them?
well, a little bit.
Andreas always wanted to take his in the bathtub, because Ernie on
oh, yeah.
but I don't know, I bet Ernie's doesn't get very wet.
I bet Ernie's doesn't squeak either.
okay, here's the rubber band again.
ready?
hmm?
you're being silly.
whoops, hold still, we're almost done.
there we go.
hmm?
he's what?
oops.
gee, busy family.
I like the bows on your sleeve there.
pretty.
nope.
well, you've got the ribbons but not the bows.
she's a bad what?
bid?
is that a he or a she?
that's one of the workmen.
yes.
pop goes the person?
what water?
I bet they do float in the water.
because they're wood.
uhhuh.
do you have one of these guys over in there?
what is that?
mm huh.
I bet you a cow's over there too.
and I think I see.
I see some of these over there too.
you're right, he's a bull.
here's a cow.
just wanted attention by Mom, huh?
yup, she did not want to take a nap, when she knew there was
oh, you want to show her that one?
what is it?
a police?
it's Dick the policeman?
oh, okay this is Dick the policeman.
Child went to work with me last week one day.
really.
I work at a junior college and there was a policeman there named
and I think she, she sort of liked him and she's been talking about
who's this?
oh, they're all Dick.
let's see what kind of people you have here.
I'll pull those over here.
here's some more animals.
what's this?
everybody is Dick.
that's not?
who's that?
a bad guy?
that looks like a woman.
to me.
bad guy.
really?
what're the bad guys doing?
in jail?
where's the jail?
uhhuh.
really?
what did they do that made them bad?
what did he do?
why are they bad?
did you watch the movie yesterday with Andreas about Horton?
Horton the elephant, Child?
did you watch?
I know he didn't want it on but did you watch it while it was on?
no?
you did what?
you sat in your booster chair?
you don't know.
there's one over there.
hidden.
uhhuh.
do you like our horses?
the little horse knocked all those big horses down?
why?
jaguar?
that's a jaguar?
that guy's pretty ugly.
that one is.
who's not going to jail?
Child, what's a jail?
what, what's a jail?
hmm?
plop?
what's plop mean?
does it mean plop over?
is that why they're all plopped over?
are you talking nonsense?
is this nonsense talk?
hmm?
plopped in?
no, that's Observer's .
I'm just letting you play with it.
we might have some of those down in the baby toys still, you know.
in, in the baby toy box, in the garage.
maybe we still have those squeaky toys.
maybe I didn't throw them away, maybe I just put them away.
we can go downstairs and look.
not right this minute.
too hard to find things, down in the garage.
after we'll go downstairs and then look in the garage for all of
those two?
well, we have this one.
you know what?
Andreas called this Stonzo.
yeah?
we have squeaky toys.
that's ours though.
that's Andreas's .
see, this is Observer's here.
it's different.
his head is loose and this one doesn't have a loose head
yes, that's right.
the blue elephant does.
yeah, he has a loose nose too.
yup.
well, it's kind of nice that he moves around.
Alexandra wants to hold on to one elephant.
did you ask Observer what happened to her broken station wagon?
Child remembered that you had a broken station wagon.
oh, yeah?
still have it, I think.
left it in there.
you have a broken car today.
never made it to the car shop.
there it is.
try to keep it on.
I was listening to some of the tapes and every single one where that
but it's fun to have something that opens.
he did?
ah.
the people should be safe.
they shouldn't get run over by cars.
I thought the people were in jail.
they've got ta go to the hospital now.
we're very careful though, right?
that we don't get run over by cars?
that's why we hold hands.
you don't ?
you don't hold hands?
of course you do.
I always make you hold my hand.
when we're near cars.
no, of course not.
we're very careful when we're in the car.
right?
we wear seatbelts so we'll be safe.
that's right and you climb out.
those poor people.
maybe we could make a family with those people.
a farm family, since there's so many farm animals.
there's not?
there's no farm animals?
there's a horse, cow, turkey, chicken.
we could make a farm, you know, if you'd like.
we have blocks over there.
would you like to get some blocks and make a farm?
what's a car farm?
we could go in the back and get our farm fence and our silo.
okay, we can bring it.
why?
what kind of a truck, hmm?
is that one Andreas's ?
where did he get it from?
oh, I know, from Bermuda, right?
that's right.
we brought this back from Bermuda for him.
hmm?
that's right.
what did you get from Bermuda?
and a hair dryer?
um hmm.
a station wagon.
a car.
that kind of car is called a station wagon.
like Barbara's car, that you ride to school in sometimes.
okay, that you ride home from school in.
you're silly.
oops.
does this open?
nope, it doesn't open but you know what?
the only thing this thing does is you can buy a trailer.
and put it, put the rope in this hole and you can pull.
you can pull a trailer.
because this is a tractortrailer truck.
but we only have one part.
I know but see but this thing can pull something else.
Lala does?
I don't think Observer knows who Lala is.
who's Lala?
you go to school with her?
Observer asked you if you go to school with her.
do you go to school with Lala?
sometimes she's sick?
are you ever sick?
Lala's Child's pretend friend.
oh.
right?
where does Lala live these days?
you don't know?
doesn't she live in the cupboard anymore?
she did?
where did she move to?
you don't know?
but you just put her prediction in, in her old house the other
only yesterday.
didn't you
so you just put it in the old one?
is it still in there?
is it?
go check and see.
what about Plum_Plum, does she live there anymore?
Child had two.
um hmm.
it's not there.
I think it's on the kitchen table.
two friends who lived in our cupboard.
yeah.
I took it out, because when I put the pots and pans in I didn't have
well, you could if you want.
if Lala doesn't live there anymore she doesn't need the prediction.
does she?
she does?
oops!
look what just flew into my hand!
uh oh.
what about Plum_plum?
Lalalilk lives there?
three friends.
alright, I'll try.
you think Dad will answer the phone?
that's good.
there you go.
you're welcome, station wagon.
hmm?
oh.
this car causes so much trouble.
whoops, sorry.
careful.
careful, you flew off backwards and you'll have a hurt head.
oh.
I can't do it.
maybe Observer can do it.
let me try it.
bring it over here?
oops.
you know what, your sister lost her elephant.
it's under your mom's foot.
you want to pick it up for her?
here.
she's trying to crawl after it.
Observer's having trouble too, huh?
you flopped in the water?
where's the water?
would you like to take swimming lessons?
is that what, is that why you're talking about flopping in the
fixed it.
she fixed it.
a very big hop.
don't chew the car, Child.
it's not good for your teeth.
that's a people road, huh?
can we stand those back up again?
how come you want everybody to lie down?
hmm?
I like the cement truck.
the cement mixer.
um hmm.
bright colors.
pretty colors.
I don't know.
does it open?
it turns though, right?
I don't know.
does it?
just a little bit, though.
do we have any cars that have doors that open?
you think that car does?
uh hmm.
a rabbit does.
uh hmm.
where is it?
you want to get it?
no, I didn't do that.
I only put things in the basement that we don't use very much.
like baby toys, uh hmm.
you have to be gentle with Andra.
she'll want it if you offer it to her.
don't , maybe you shouldn't put it on her, so she doesn't try to have
she can't ?
you gave him to her.
I don't remember that.
over Dick.
poor Dick the policeman.
you think he likes to be run over with the car?
in the road?
you know, if you put those people, people up on the table they would
I think you hurt someone's feelings.
okay.
I think you better say sorry, Alexandra.
did she hurt your feelings by saying no to you, is that
let her have Dick.
let her have Dick.
it keeps her happy, okay?
you know, she's just a baby.
oh, really.
is that why she didn't cry?
I think she didn't cry because she has Dick in her hand.
see, if you take Dick away and you say no then she gets mad, and
let's not try it.
you have all those people to play with.
so she can have Dick.
well, let's trade, let's give her one of those instead.
why don't you pick one out?
you're thinking?
which one are you thinking about giving her?
which one?
that, that little little one?
the very littlest one?
oh, this one instead, huh?
there, see, she's interested as long as she has one to hold on to.
yeah, don't put it in your mouth.
because Observer has to go and take those to other children.
other two, other two year old children.
like the children in your class.
you know, like Emily, Suzanne, Jessie, Jason, Christopher.
right?
right, Observer?
Christopher's not in your class?
you know what?
if we move this table you could stand the people up on the table.
would you like to stand them up?
no, I don't want you to run the car on the table.
no.
not unless you give her another one to play with.
you think she'll like such a small one?
well, let's see.
why don't you offer it to her?
you mean you want to keep trading?
sometime she might say no.
she just got it.
she wants to look at it.
she's looking at it to see what it is.
no, don't , don't .
well, squeaking it at her's okay, but knocking her on the head with
she doesn't like that.
do you like it?
let me see if I like it.
no, I don't like it much.
too loud.
oh, it's much too loud and it pulls my hair.
stand up the mother.
she can't ?
try.
you're going to fall off.
there's a little girl with a cat.
who's that?
Dick?
who's this?
what does this look like?
a man who goes to church?
really?
because he's Greek?
hmm.
yeah.
he looks like a Greek man, huh?
why does he look Greek?
maybe because he's big what?
oh, a brown coat.
what's this around his neck?
a scarf?
a necktie.
it's a necktie.
so he looks like a Greek man that goes to church, huh?
what's he carrying in his hand?
I think it's a briefcase.
it's not?
what is it?
oh here, look, you can see it from this side too.
what do you think?
oh, okay.
so he's a Greek man.
why don't you go stand him up on the table?
what about this person?
he is?
what kind of a Greek man?
a Greek man doing what?
a church Greek man.
you sat on something  to squeak
here comes trouble.
yeah.
okay.
let her have one, okay?
it keeps her happy.
you have so many.
so many people.
what's the orange guy?
with the ball in his hand?
this one here in the front.
the orange one.
with the numbers on his chest.
on his shirt.
this one right there.
what numbers are they?
maybe oh or eight?
maybe.
you are?
you're going to give some?
no.
uhhuh.
oh, you have so many.
that's good.
that's good.
I'm glad you're taking them out of jail.
whoops!
they're all standing?
how about if I give your sister one of the animals?
you think she'll like that?
they all stand up.
which one's Dick?
which one is Dick?
that one.
because he has on a hat?
is that why he's Dick?
air comes out, huh?
oops.
do the animals stand up too?
look who's tired here.
look at this.
somebody's tired.
let her have one.
okay?
thanks.
what happens when you knock the table?
looks like they dance, doesn't it?
they didn't just fall over, I think somebody pushed them over.
it wasn't ?
are the ladies, are the women Dick?
ah.
look what happened.
oh, dear.
okay.
I think you moved the table by accident, huh?
did you want them to all fall over?
uh hmm.
he did.
it's hard, it's hard to do it that way, Child.
it's hard to put the ones in the front up first.
oops.
see?
did you get them all?
oh.
whoops!
the domino effect.
uh hmm.
keep knocking over, huh.
that looks like a grandfather.
I see, you've got them all standing up.
oops.
okay.
so they're all going to sleep?
are they sleeping on their tummies?
look, they're all sleeping right on their faces.
on their tummies?
oh, hurted her bum?
Child, careful.
don't want cars falling on people who are sleeping!
no?
yeah?
on bunk beds?
like you have a bunk bed?
no, you don't go on the top.
that's right.
that's right.
because Andreas is bigger.
and what about Alexandra?
do you sleep in a crib?
not this morning.
so they're all sleeping on their tummies?
I see one guy's face.
the Greek guy.
going to church.
what are you doing?
you humming?
now I see Dick's face.
uh hmm.
oh, the cement mixer?
it's not that?
I thought that was what you wanted.
you know what, Child, I've got another one of those.
you can have one and give one to Alexandra, too.
wow.
look.
let Alexandra have one.
you can share, right?
why does Observer have two?
I don't know.
why don't you ask her?
no, what?
no, what?
no, don't eat it.
which is it?
yeah, but
but they're the same.
they're cement mixers.
you want two?
then you better offer her a different truck, I think.
you'll have to get a different oops!
she's very expressive.
um!
you ought to look at one year old communication.
that's fine.
a very few.
whatever works works.
you did?
I think she has too many things now.
would you like the elephant?
two elephants and two cement trucks?
is everybody asleep again?
what's Dick doing?
I don't see anybody's face.
everybody's sleeping on their tummy.
who?
her who?
oh yeah, the grandmother.
I see her face.
I see grandmother's face.
nope.
because you turned her.
I don't know, do I?
Alexandra, do you want two elephants?
want that?
I didn't take it away.
it just fell.
there's too many, too many toys.
why?
shall we go and get a haircut this week?
look how long your bangs are.
they're down and they're in your eyes.
maybe we should go to the hairdresser.
hairdresser.
beauty shop.
would you like to go to the beauty shop and get your hair cut?
would you sit still?
while somebody cuts your hair?
Karen cuts Andreas's hair.
would you like to go see somebody like Karen?
and wear a bib?
and get a lollipop afterwards?
did you drop it last time?
is that what happened?
you dropped it and it got dirty?
well, maybe you willn't drop it next time.
take the plastic off to eat it though, okay?
no.
so let's make an appointment and go get your hair cut.
too many things for such a small girl.
yeah, that's better.
just some at a time is better.
make up your mind.
your mind.
I think she wanted both of them.
uhhuh.
I see.
I don't know.
ask Observer about that.
why do I have two of what?
I can't see.
oh, two of the cement trucks?
well, I think because sometimes, you know, when we go to a house
with Alexandra we have three children.
oops.
sorry.
three children at our house.
six people in our house, huh?
that's a lot.
that's a lot of people.
I don't know.
is his head all smashed in?
who did that to poor old ducky?
can I help you fix her?
there.
you fixed it yourself, huh?
yeah.
oh, Alexandra, did you just wet your diaper and go on my leg?
will you stay here and play while I go change Alexandra?
I'll come right back.
hmm?
well, how about if I leave Alexandra here and I'll just bring her
okay?
okay.
just be careful what she takes.
yeah, don't throw the toys.
yeah, don't give her so much.
I'm giving her all of them.
oop, she doesn't want those.
she wants something different.
look at this.
what's this?
oop, should we lie it down too?
and is this a sheep too?
what's that?
looks like she wants the sheep.
you know what this is?
a duck.
it's called a mallard duck.
Make_way_for_ducklings?
Mr and Mrs Mallard.
right and their family?
her mat?
because I didn't want to change her on the couch.
here.
here comes a gorilla.
an ugly gorilla.
got a dry diaper.
yes, the dry diaper that you picked, that's right.
whoops, she dropped something.
can you get something for her hand?
there's no poop.
would you go throw this in the trash for me?
help me out?
no?
gee, thanks.
you're usually such a big helper.
no, you're not a helper now?
that's too bad, I thought you were.
this is the one you picked.
I know, I took it out of the somebody's house bag.
oh, come on.
we'll put another one in that diaper bag.
it's no big deal.
okay.
hmm?
okay.
okay, pick another diaper.
I think her attention span is, ah, exhausted.
how are we going to do that?
well.
hmm?
you don't know?
well, I don't see any green sticks there, do you?
ummhm.
ok.
hmm.
that's right.
that's right.
very good.
now where does it go?
ummhm.
ummhm.
boy, it looks pretty complicated, Child.
want to put those on the bottom there?
hmm?
I don't know, let's see.
I put this one here.
I can't figure out how they work.
I'm just trying to figure it out!
what are you doing?
you're trying to blow that, make a sound out of it?
um.
now let me see.
there we go.
well, that's the start of one.
wait, where's the man going to go?
let's put the man on.
Honey, take this out of your mouth.
sounds like a helicopter.
hmm?
it's up in the sky.
it's looking, it must be, maybe it's looking for something.
ok.
you want to put the man on?
no?
oh, you mean you're going to make, make me do the whole thing?
you'll help me?
well, then you can get some red sticks.
you want to get some red sticks out?
ok.
let's put them right here.
those?
you're right, Child, we do look at that.
very good!
now let's finish?
very good, what comes next?
uh hmm, we do.
uh hmm.
uh hmm.
well, here's one of these.
let's see, this is sort of an improvised one, hmm?
we sort of improvised here, didn't we?
what about this?
yes, that looks like a forklift, doesn't it?
well
alright.
you mean you'll make me have to do it like it really is supposed to
let's see, we're going to have to
put this here, this here.
whoops, excuse me.
these drive me crazy.
someone gave these to him.
about four or five, no, four or five months ago, I think.
he doesn't play, he really got into it for a while and then
yeah.
and also he got them out again the other day, now we're back into
but they don't , they, you know, the wheels keep coming off, and
yeah.
do you want to get your horn out and play your horn?
hmm?
the one that you got for Christmas?
and sing a little song?
no.
no.
now that looks more like it.
yes, it is.
yes
Child, what do you think is in here?
why don't we look in there?
want to look inside and grab something?
there might be something interesting in there.
oh.
wow, look at that, a book.
wow.
oh.
oh, what is that?
is that a sheep?
or a poodle dog?
looks like a fancy poodle dog, hmm?
Child, do you think anything opens up there?
no, it doesn't look like it does.
oh, well, maybe.
look, opens up.
uhhuh.
well, let's look and see.
that looks like a cement mixer.
let's look and see what else is in there.
oh, what are those?
um hmm.
what is that?
looks like a cow that's lying down.
hmm?
what else is in there?
hmm.
yes.
what's that?
a pony!
oh, another one.
you know what we could do?
we could make a garage for the trucks and a barn for the animals.
look at that.
how many, um, how many, um, cement mixers do we have here?
oh, what's that?
I don't know, what are these called?
porcupines?
oh.
hedgehog.
it's a hedgehog!
it's a squishy hedgehog.
and what's this one over here?
which?
ummhm!

what is that?
well, what do you think?
no.
um hmm.

that's right!
uh hmm.
it's a, I think it's a word book.
well, it's a, it's , I think it's called a word book.
there's no story but there are all sorts of words that go together
what is it?
yeah.
all of them?
you want to do that?
go get your blocks out?
um hmm.
um hmm.
it's a funny hedgehog.
ok.
want to get the blocks out?
I don't know, we were looking for that yesterday, and I couldn't

we'll have to do it without a wheel.
he turned the motor off?
did you put him there?
oh, good.
oh, good.
do you want to put the animals in their stalls first?
no, ok.
what are we doing?
wow.
oh, ok.
way up in the air?
that's pretty clever.
how's he going to do that?

and that makes the tractor go up in the air?
hmm.
that's very clever.
that's very clever.
now.
you going home?
ok.
where is his stall?
well, how about over here in these stalls here?
what, what do you want?

what did they do to bump their nose?
they're going to be careful?
good, I'm glad.
is it all set for him?
well, what do we have to do to make it set for him?
yes.
I think it's a poodle dog.
um hmm.
that looks like a collie dog.
it's a different kind of dog.
should we get some blocks out?
oh, lion.
oh, Big Bird too.
I get Big Bird?
very nice.
are we going to build a, uh, are we going to build a barn, Child, for the
we are.
can you get some more blocks out so we can build?
I think she can see.
I think she can see.
we're going to have a parade?
let's do this first.
oh, thank you.
he's going to grab it in his paw?
now what do I do with it?
right there?
ok.
you want to give me another block?
oh, ok, where're we going to put that?

then they can walk up the ramp and walk along there.
right there.
like this.
ah, ok.
cl.
farmer!
farmer!
farmer!
yes, Child?
why not?
well, would you hurry up and finish so I can put my animals in the
I've got a poodle dog and a collie dog and a pony and a cow that's
a sheep?
that's a dog.
well, it's white.
it looks like a sheep but I think it's called a puddle, a
we can pretend it's a sheep if you want.
ok.
where shall we put those?
you tell me.
how about, let's see.
we were going to make some stalls here.
to put the animals in.
make a door?
how are we going to make a door?
there.
this could be the door.
swing it open, swing it closed.
should we do it that way?
you swing it open when you want to put an animal in there?
who should we put in there?
hmm?
you want to put the elephant in?
do you want to get some of your own animals out?
no.
ok.
oh.
you want to close the door?
there.
now he's all nice in his little stall for the night.
should we give him some hay?
except, except you know that's a dog and I don't know that dogs eat
I bet they eat dog food.
we don't know about that because we don't have a dog but I think
does he love hay?
there.
now.
oh, a garage.
well, you want to make a stall for him?
and a door?
I don't know that dogs eat, eat a lot of hay.
I think horses like hay and cows like hay.
and sheep, well, sheep eat grass.
I don't know if they like hay.
dogs, dogs like dog bones.
they like to chew on bones and eat dog food.
hi, Child.
and who else?
what about me?
am I here playing with you?
yes.
your train?
want to get your train out?
well, we're not going to play soccer ball right now.

not in the house, ok?
we can go outside later and play that.
maybe if Investigator's still here.
now you want to finish the, the barn or you want to get your train
alright, let's put some of these things away so we have room for
empty.
it's the what to the train?
oh.
should we get your train out?
I'm not sure I feel like playing tinker toys this morning.
hmm?

are you sure?
well, what are we going to do with these animals here?
we're going to give them a rest?
they're going to watch?
alright.
you want to leave them all right here?
what about the farmer?

lookit.
um hmm.
you want to make that one?
you can't make that one then, huh?
no.
they have different sets and we don't have the orange ones, do we?
but what do we do sometimes?
do we improvise, is that what we do?
you want to try to make that?
well, what do we need?
yes, we do.
you want to get those out?
a sword?
you're going to fly it?
hmm.
where's it going?
well, what do we need?
let's see here, what do we need?
you want to get the yellow sticks and the green sticks out?
ok, now where we going to put those?
well, that's the start of that wrecker that we're going to make.
you want to put the yellow ones right in there?
it's hard, it's hard to understand.
there, very good, Child.
there.
pretty fancy.
well, I put that there.
sort of.
we're sort of improvising here.
how does this go?
I'm trying to make that.
I need a little yellow, uh, orange one like this, Child.
yeah, you've got it.
can you give it to me?
just like that one of the little ones.
are you using that?
ok.
now what do I do?
oh.

cause they keep falling off and
see, everything keeps falling off, Child.
um.
let's do something else, shall we?
can we do something else?
how about some other toys?
I'd like to make a barnyard for your animals, that's what I'd like
make a big barn for the animals, and a farmyard.
hmm?
these look awfully complicated.
well, which one do you want to make?
a locomotive.
why don't we get our own locomotive out and fill that up?
I haven't seen that in a while, the one that Uncle Rick gave you for
the one Uncle Rick gave you for Christmas, it's over there, in the
let's get that out and put some things in it, ok?
let's put these away.
for now.
on my back?
I don't think they fit on my back.
careful, don't spill them, whoa, there they go.

I can tell you what to do.
you want to have a parade?
what am I going to do?
oh, the yellow thing?
you have put it away.
in the tinker toy box.
because we wouldn't want to lose it, would we?

very good, Child.
there's the dump truck.

bless you.
mmm.
it's a what car?
scraper car.
that's probably a good zoomer, Child.

zoom it over to Investigator.
oh.
there.
backwards?
see what happens.
oh.
whoop.

how about if you take the animals on a train ride?
we could do that.
you want to put the animals on, and take them for a train ride?
hmm?

you put the string in here.
Paul was watching and his head was going up and down.
when you get it down you have to jerk it a little so it will come.
oh yes, you can.
now pull it.
no.
what're you doing over in the corner, Paul?
it takes time to learn how to use it properly.

what does that mean?
that's the name of the toy.
yes, it's my turn.
yes.
some what?
some glasses.
now pull it up.
Paul, stop.
yes, so it willn't be difficult to get it out.
put it on your middle finger.
how did you hurt it?
because it's easier to do I think.
probably.
just pull it straight up, alright.
yes, that's all you have to do.
because those are pretty colors.
oh yes, I think you're getting it.
oh yes, when you're learning things you have to miss sometimes.
what?
you just what?
what kind of work do you do?
oh, it's your business.
no, don't pull them, Adam.
good, Adam.
almost.
pull the string up.
oh, you have big glasses.
I think Paul would like to see you.
oh, you are?
oh, I'm green?
oh, I don't mind.
when you take the glasses off am I still green?
Paul doesn't know what to think about you.
let him have a turn, alright?
alright.
it's your turn.
that was long ago.
what light?
who's in your chair?
you did what?
you did what, Adam?
did you try to open it?
I don't think that duck can drive very well.
I don't think that duck can drive very well.
he knocked the pig off and ran over the goat.
he's a dangerous driver.
I don't think that's sixty four.
his mother locked the door?
why?
oh no, I saw it.
the duck didn't get hurt, did he?
oh, he doesn't know where he's driving?
no, you have that and Paul is playing with that.
Paul is playing with the trailer because you had the barn.
oh, I don't know.
I should think you could find a parking space almost any place.
he what?
oh, now he's a very good driver?
you're caught by a fish?
is that brown one a duck too?
yes, since Paul's playing with the barn.
look, Adam.
yes, Paul had the glasses on.
I don't think he'll let me.
yes.
how did you break your window?

I don't think I understand what you're talking about?
you mean the windshield like that?
on the car?
oh yes, I don't know where that is.
what light?
oh yes.
I'm sure it must be on.
you let him use that while you're driving the car?
yes.
I guess he was just measuring the string to see how long it was.
you don't want anything in there?
this is a real microscope.
microscope.
don't you want to look through here first?
mmhm.
we need a small mirror.
no, a tiny mirror.
we need something to look at.
we could use a hair.
because we're going to look at it under a microscope.
I didn't bring him.
he came by himself.
he came in through the open door.
Rinny, no no.
no, I see some big ropes.
Paul, no no.
can you look through that hole?
no, look through the hole, honey.
did you see it?
it's what you call a mechanical toy, yes.
no no.

oh, I suppose it's something you can make.
different things, different shapes.

Mr Dragon, you don't like blocks?
ice.

it looks like a cow but I've never seen a cow with a beard.
it's a bull?
you've never seen one of those?
oh, you have so.
let's put these up first.
I don't bring water in my bag.
why?
I couldn't carry it.
it would spill all over.
yes.
what did you do?
no.
because then you can't paint.
no no, he's not bothering you.
he's just looking.
maybe Adam would like to paint his popsicle sticks.
here they all are.
dip the brush in paint lots of times so it's one color.
you could do all those colors.
roll it around until you get a good color.
oh yes.
put it back in the yellow.
you get nice thick colors.
oh, that's pretty, Adam.
oh, that's very pretty, Adam.
yes, that's very very pretty, Adam.
no no, you can't have the paint.
no I don't think he needs it.
that would spoil the paints.
it's not a tricycle stick.
it's a popsicle stick.
you did.
the people in the factory where they make the popsicles put the
and then you eat frozen whatever it is.
and then they throw the popsicle stick away.
yes.
no, they shouldn't throw it on the sidewalk at all, should they?
that's where we found those.
that's right.
is that what you do?
you do it.
what kind?
you mean what color?
did you make me blue?
know what that color is?
is it?
I think it's brown too.
you may leave them there.
here's your can.
here's another one.
don't use so much water.
don't you need some color?
what is it?
that's right.
alright.
how colored they are.
why don't you count them?

have you finished with the paint?
yes.
I'm a nice what?

alright.
would you like to see how many of these we found, Adam?
I don't know if there's a whole set or not.
it's to draw.

so they willn't be so stretched.
mmhm.
I'll hold it while you put yours down.
put this back first, Adam.
do you like this?
no.
oh, Paul.
no, not lobster.
they're part of rabbit.
they're part of big rabbit.
well yes, like lobsters.
but that's after the skin is off.
you, Paul.
Adam, go look on the bed and bring Paul one of your books.
I think there're some old books there that are all torn.
mmhm.
now put this back in the bag, Adam.
do you think Robin uses that?
yes, since he's a big boy and goes to school.
what kind of school do you go to?
you don't learn how to count at nursery school.
you do?
can you count?
ok.
if you can count tell me how many I have up there.
don't step on the book, honey.
these are what kind of people?
Eskimo.
would you like me to read?
I'd like to see it.
Paul would like to see it.
we need something like a shoelace to spin it.
yes.
there's one in there under your bed.
you go this way.
because it's closer.
that's just right.
now you hold onto the handle and pull as fast as you can pull.
how can you tell it's going to stop?
you're going to do it.
now hold on to the handle and pull hard.
hold back a little further.
good.
yes, you did.
yes.
what's going up in the sky?
move your hand a little farther?
no, Adam will do it this time and you may do it next time.
he couldn't do that, could you, Paul?
that's right.
you have to wrap it around first.
good.
that pretty.
yes.
that was very good.
there it is.
no, you tricked yourself.
you didn't know where it went.
like a snake?
it wobbles in like a snake?
I'll be right back.
yes.
oh, she is.
did she come to visit?
does she play with you?
I'll go upstairs later.
uhhuh.
good for you, Adam.
Adam put it on the other way, I think.
is it easier this way?
yes.
wrap the gas in?
you did?
that was very good.
is it Paul's turn?
you look sleepy.
yes, I see.
yes.
no, I don't know what a grabby boat is.
please, tell me.
a grabby boat is for shirts?
sweaters too?
will I find any blouses on the grabby boat?
any dresses?
any pants?
yes, you are.
you can count?
can you read?
no, Paul can't count either.
oh, I'm sure Robin can read.
you and Robin are friends.
oh yes, you can.
you're a big boy.
perhaps the shoelace got tangled that time.
it's your turn.
you have to show me how to do it.
how do you do it?
what do I turn around?
what do I turn around?
this?
it willn't turn.
like that?
well, what do I pull?
oh.
oh, thank you, big boy.
oh, you scratched the record?
now are you goING To help me this time.

alright?
oh, Paul.
look, here it is.
poor little baby.
ok, is it Paul's turn?
why don't you turn it now so he can see it?
he likes to see it turn.

yes, you are a big boy.
you have to do what?

no no, let him have that one, dear.
has a what?
top and no bottom.
you need some paper first.
what can you use for paper?
no no, those are Daddy's things.
why don't you use the newspaper there on the sewing machine?
that's a magazine.
are you ready for some water?
we don't have any different colors.
no no, you put the water in here.
no, because next time you want to use the paints they would be all

what tire do you see in the store?
why are you doing that?
but you just painted it.
you can't wash paint until it dries.
no, because you've taken the paint off.
the paint's all on your hands.
no no, don't put your fingers in it, Adam.
have you finished here?
well, then don't wash your hands until you've finished.
so you're all finished.
no, you said you had finished.
no no.
this is Paul's .
but you want to wash your hands.
why did you wash your hands?
would you close that door, please?
no, so that
so that we willn't hear the noise from out there.
you paint with a paint brush.
why're doing that?
that's not finger paint.
that's water color.
use your brush, honey.
yes, for painting.
no, it's not fingerpaint.
you're silly.
yes, if you put it aside and let it dry.

why did you waste your paint?
but you painted it first.
until you wash it off.
you mean a fish net?
why not?
yes, I like swordfish.
no, I wouldn't like to catch a swordfish.
because I don't know that much about fishing.
you do?
well, how would you keep the swordfish from sticking you in the

that's the windshield wiper.
what does the windshield wiper do?
oh, that's the windshield wiper for paint.

can you leave it like that?
just like that.
yes.
oh, is that the way you drive it?

hello, Joe.
we're at the farm now.
that's just some
some greenery, some grass, some shrubs.
what's an animal man?

what does fold mean?
what does fold mean?
did you get all the animals out?
what about these animals?

perhaps there's some more of it some place.
does it really belong under there?
I don't think you have the barn quite finished yet.
do you see any parts there that you fold?
you fold on the dotted lines.
do you see any lines there?
you didn't quite finish taking it out.

hmm?
we just have part of it.
perhaps Robin started putting it together and didn't finish.
you have a part missing.
there's a part that goes in between the top and the bottom.
don't you think that looks like the roof?
where's the part that goes in between?
that's what's missing.
yes.

you have to get out over there.
there's nobody in either car, so how're you going to get out.

I see you.
careful, there's a lady on the sidewalk.
alright.
your tongue hurts.
what do you have here?
oh, you eat too much?

Paul, look at the telephones.

yes.
oh.

hello.
it's a very long wire.
does your light go on?
yes.
oh, Paul.
except I think it's supposed to be at your ear.
you hold it up to your ear?

do you mean untangle it?
tangle means put it back like it was.
is that what you want?
that's a very long number.

now how did that light go on before?
that's a plug, an earphone plug.
you can take care of yours and Paul can take care of his?
wait, now why are you changing?
it's alright, Paul.
I don't know why he wants to change.
dog, yes.
what happened to it?

you'd throw a spear at the tuna fish so that he wouldn't eat his
an eel
yes, it's like a snake.
and see amoebas
they're like the others, aren't they?
when the little fish had learned to swim together like one giant
do you know why he was going to be the eye?
why do you think he's going to be the eye?
they're all swimming together and they look like one big fish and
do you know why he's the eye?
what do you think happened?
you'd like to give Adam one.
yes.
do you want another book?
no?
do you want this?
yes.
ok.
that's right.
no no, Adam.
what did you say?
there's one in the middle of the shoe?
do you remember that?
lift it up a little while you're pulling.
maybe it gets stuck on the end.
a crashed lady?
why does she look like a crashed lady?
maybe that shoelace isn't very good, Adam.

this way.
why do you want to do that?
no no, Adam.

I think so.
do I want to see what?
these intelligent slides?
don't you have to turn it around?
Paul, look here.
who is that?
oh, you do have a big shadow there.
that looks like an animal, doesn't it?
that's just the shadow of you and the slide.
if you turn it that way what does it look like?
what does the shadow look like when you turn it?
if you turn it that way it looks like something to me.
yes, I thought it looked like a rooster too.
would you show it to Ursula?
here's one, Adam that you'd like to see.
yes, it's very light.
let Paul see.
no, that's when we lived in Cambridge.
you were standing and he took the picture.

what does intelligent mean, Adam?
oh, you finished.
no, there are some on the floor.
put one in there and show it to him, Adam, please.
here's one.
that's what?
I don't think you ought to put in two at a time, Adam.
you won't see anything.
why don't you let Paul put one in and then we'll be finished
no no, one at a time.
you might break it, Adam.
you only put one in at a time.
what is that?
I don't know.
maybe something at the
arts festival last year.
that's another bronze.
I think so.
oh, why would you dump them out?
she'd like to see that one.
well, how can she see it if you don't press it?
I don't want to look at Bozo.
I'd like to watch the Friendly Giant.
no.
that's a picture of you when you were a little baby.
why is it dark?
why is it dark?
because what?
because you took the plug out, I see.
let's put this back first.
Paul was trying to put that one in his shoe.
a slide.
that's a camera.
now maybe you could put a screw in that hole.
what happened?
shall I help you put it back on?
alright.
it's a screw driver.
he can hold one.
he won't lose it.
no, you have to put the screw all the way in.
it's good exercise for you.
let him play with that.
there's one in your hand.
I'm a silly lady.
for what?
when you turn it.
Adam wants to use it now.
let him have a turn with that while you.
he needs both of the, he says.
Adam, let him turn this, please and then you may have it when
careful.
what'd you say?
you make a hole for Paul.
no, I don't think that would work.
alright, Adam.
would you drill a hole for Paul, please?
please, drill a hole for your little brother.
he knows you're such a nice big boy who can do so many things so much
he wants to play with you.
alright, Paul.
he's going to drill a hole for you.
what do you think is wrong?
I think something's wrong with that.
it doesn't seem to be making a hole.
what's what for?
I don't know exactly.
you can keep the board.
what're you looking at, Adam?
oh really.
ok.
come on.
put yours on.
maybe we should set this.

oh, you don't have any lights?
what happens at night then?
oh, Paul, you're a little character.

I like a nice clean backyard.
no, I don't think they have their lights on all the time.
I don't think it blinks all the time, does it?
the white light?
at night?
yes, they do.
perhaps they leave the blinking light on too, I don't know.
what are my slides doing in there?
shame on you.
you take that one, I'll keep this one.

oh no, he didn't say anything about window.
he said winner.
a tricycle has a back, yes.
a bike has a back like that.
oh, I forgot.
oh, that's the kind you just push, Adam.
oh, do you know what that story's about?
Adam?
he's calling you.
that's for somebody to put their fingers through so they can hold

what was your costume?
David had just the same.

that's right.
mmhm.
oh, you're taking your turn, alright?
alright.
would you like some under here?
would you like some, Diandra?
well, put your bowl down.
a water fountain.
yes.
oh, what else is a different thing?
you're spilling what you have.
all gone.
well, I don't think there's any more in there.
would you like some help, Adam?
Paul, I don't think she needs your help.
you've had enough.
let's see if we do it this way.
yes.
what?
that's enough, Adam.
he can't hold that much.
Paul isn't going get any more?

oh, don't come out, tiger.
oh, the nice lion.
Adam, you know better than to throw.
would you like this back?
do what?
well, he's trying to do it.
he has to learn how.
yes, that's the one for a big boy like you.
it looks like those legs might belong to a little girl.
a book.
the elephant will stand up too.
I don't know about the lion.
yes.
I think I'll bring it back again.
don't you think I can get water here?
oh.
I couldn't carry very much.
oh well, why don't you play some more and then maybe you'll
I think it's upsidedown.
that's where the bell was.
when you close the book.
you hit the bottom of the
and this goes way up if you're very strong and hits a bell.
yes.
oh, thank you.
Paul, no, that's Adam's .
thank you.
that's a firetruck.
car.
that's no car, that's firetruck.

you give me a kiss.
those are stands for the other animals.
have one what?
yes, there's one on the other side.
where're you going?
dog.
oh, there is a dog on that page.
you're at the zoo.
you can't find water at the zoo.
is that right?
two toes.
is that a giraffe?
what about the monkey?
yes, you may have yours back.
what did I have?
these?
oh no, you took your back, didn't you?
peanuts, yes.
all getting some peanuts?
oh, thank you.
goodbye at the zoo.
yes.
he's a talking house.
no, I never heard of a talking house either.
I guess he's just a little boy.
he's little boy house?
that's a door.
oh, you are.
you have to work a little harder.
oh, I have plenty, thank you.
but I have plenty.
I can't drink so much.
what?
can you drink two cups at once?
alright.
you can keep those.
alright.
and then I'll bring it back sometimes.
what other things would you like me to bring back that I brought
do you think that's a clock?
in case you want to ride your car on it?
I still have some water.
do you want to drink this?
alright.
why do you think it makes the bubbles?
why does it make so many bubbles?
lots of what?
spots?
you mean the water's dirty?
whoops, it's spilling over.
oh, Adam.
what're you going to do about that, Adam?
pour some in another cup.
why don't we clean up this tray?
you don't want your cup what?
you're drying the cup?
what else're you going to have?
well no, I think I better take that back and bring it again.
what?
did you ever have something called flupperc millerc?
what's it look like?
I never heard of a Flupper_nutter.
you did?
squeeze?
we better put a cup under there.
shall we pour that in there?
let's see if I can get it out this time.
yes.
can I see yours?
no, I think that's enough, Adam.
so it be a bigger what?
no.
that'll be enough.
this is hard to do.
then maybe that's enough.
how about this?
that's a new one.
I'll start it for you.
I got it started, Adam.
yes.
you need it to fly the plane.
that's right.
you do?
well, let's see.
where do the wings go?
you don't remember?
just push this down.
don't you suppose it goes like that?
Paul, he'll show you how it goes.
he'll show you how it goes like a good big brother.
big brother shows you how everything goes.
don't you, big brother?
why not?
what happens at eight thirty?
I need the directions, Adam.
Diandra, come over here.
what happens at eight thirty?
you're taking off at eight thirty?
there's not enough instructions for me.
nope.
it says do it like this.
and then you let it go like that.
one end goes here
that's the way.
oh, that's alright.
it'll dry out.
do you want to try, Adam?
well, why don't you leave it on and then well alright.
I guess that will still fly.
alright.
back up, pilot.
what?
outside.
it's not eight thirty yet?
come on, Diandra.
let's look in the basket.
alright.
tall tall tower.
I see.
please, pilot, don't run into me.
oh please, don't ride on my back, airplane.
Adam, do you know what this is?
it's not a clock really, it's a compass.
it tells you directions.
it has on numbers that tell you north east south and west.
the airplane needs to know what direction it's going in.
that's right.
especially airplanes because they don't have any roads to go on.
they have to know which way they're going.
yes then, they don't have to use the compass.
there's another one.
no no, Adam.
here, Diandra.
here's another one.
why are you going to take his, Adam?
you don't have any.
in the dark?
tonight?
what about today?
yes, dis is Ursula's day.
that's right.
is there a television on the airplane?
do you?
that's the nose.
that's where you put the rubber band.
no, those are his, Adam Smith, did you hear me?
it doesn't help to cry.
the wheels might be up in here.
they don't drop down until you're ready to land.
when it's flying in the air you don't need wheels.
where you going?
see what happens?
sure.
no, Adam had the compass, Paul.
are you going to draw an airplane?
just like yours?
alright here.
would you like a piece of her paper?
say thank you.
what're you going to draw?
airplane too?
Mommy.
how does he look when it's snow time?
thank you very kindly, Adam, that was very nice of you.
you have to ask for it.
I put mine away over here.
no, you're drawing for me, aren't you?
I thought you drew one for me.
did you go to school yesterday, Adam?
what would it look like?
how many?
here's the wing.
that's hard.
here's a star.
will you make the star?
there.
ok.
is that a hard paper?
maybe if you put it on the puzzle it would be easier, wouldn't it?
that's nice.
uhhuh.
it has a Beetle?
a bl?
did you make a tail?
how about a tail light?
how many wings?
that's a what?
why is that an octopus?
what is that, Adam?
that's a good idea.
are you the pilot?
no?
the driver sometimes is called the pilot.
I can't see them.
where are they?
oh yes, I can.
can you show which is the wing?
who's on the airplane now?
nobody?
it's in the garage?
does it have enough gas?
oh yes.
does it have a compass?
the thing inside the tire is a compass.
would this do?
what?
I've never seen him.
oh, thank you.
when is he on early in the morning?
did you see him already today?
tomorrow would be fine.
is it very early in the morning?
I might not be able to get here that early.
yes?
I live in Cambridge, remember?
you used to live in Cambridge, remember?
yes, on Trowbridge Street.
and I used to come and visit you.
do you know where you live?
yes, would you, please?
do you know how to spell it?
ul.
rl.
sl.
il.
el.
that's all.
should I write your name now?
how do you spell it?
al.
dl.
al.
ml.
there it is.
that's right.
how do you get the wheels down?
oh yes.
how do you make them go up?
isn't that nice.
what were you going to say about your Daddy?
that's nice of you.
a dog?
a dart?
oh, that's a wheel.
that's your dot maker.
Adam, which crayon is longer?
which one?
show me.
what color paper would you like?
the light blue or the dark blue?
this one?
this one?
what color is that?
that's Robin's favorite color too.
no?
what do you need?
is this what you need?
maybe this is what you need.
yes, what would you like?
shall we each have a piece?
I'll have to make a square first.
I could make a bird.
what other one?
out of this piece?
that was a sneeze.
how do you sneeze?
now do the way I sneeze.
it says I need another paper?
not yet.
I have to finish folding it first.
it's supposed to be a bird, not a tent.
you fold it to be a wing.
should we get the telephone?
no no, Daddy answered it.
you did.
well, isn't that nice?
there's your bird.
oh, is that right.
oh, it's not a very heavy airplane, is it?
I didn't even feel it.
I'm glad you do.
the tape recorder's working, and so is the doorbell?
neither one.
what was wrong with it?
but it wouldn't work?
don't you think I could sit in that chair?
I usually sit there.
do you think I could sit in it this morning?
do you think I could sit in it this morning?
what does he do?
what kind of fish?
how did you catch them?
what're you doing with the fish?
what happened to your shoe?
careful.
that looks like a piece of rug to me.
if you say so.
who wears that?
you wear it?
let's see.
oh yes.
look.
they're going to fall out, aren't they?
where's your doggie?
how big is he now?
he's growing.
which things?
that's question mark and that's a question mark.
because it's a book of riddles.
no, riddles.
what fish do what?
why are fish so smart?
see all the fish?
they're so smart because they always go around in schools.
what?
what do you think?
it says what hurts more than a giraffe with a sore throat?
a centipede with sore feet.
what do you think?
that's right.
it's a box of quackerswp.
what's he doing?
would you rather have an elephant chase you or a lion?
let's see what the next page is.
in bed?
what happened to the turtle?
let me see.
why don't you put an ad in the paper when you lost your dog?
he's crying because he lost his dog.
did he find it?
yes, certainly.
do you know what letter that is?
hl?
al, that's right.
ok.
well, it's got a line this way too.
alright.
so many!
look how many al-s you've got.
how many are there?
count them.
what is it?
do you know what that's called?
a magnet.
do you know what your name starts with?
do you know what that is?
that's right.
that's not a letter, that's a sign for dividing.
when you have lots of things and you share them with your brother
which baby?
you mean Paul?
you're going to divide things with him.
almost, but you need an ml.
and then it has three lines.
do you have a crayon?
look, an el looks like that.
there's a yellow one and a blue one.
there's a red one too.
over on this side.
what about that?
that's a long one, isn't it?
alright.
yes.
that's going to be Adam.
that's a marker when you find all those letters then you can write
you need just one more.
just put that one in in the right place.
this is the start al.
dl.
we just had an al.
where did it go?
alright.
which one?
the ml?
you've got one right there.
right nearby.
what do you use your name for?
yes, which one do you want me to draw, this one?
that one?
no, we have to find a crayon to write on there.
no, because that willn't come off but crayons do.
I didn't find a crayon, did you?
alright.
who're you going to shoot?
what?
no, but I can bring it back.
I like to bring things back because then they're surprises.
I know you do.
for what kind of pistol?
I don't know that kind.
al for book?
is that what book starts with?
do you want to know how to write Mommy?
start with this ml then you need an ol.
no, now we're writing Mommy.
we need another ml.
because that's how you spell Mommy.
yes.
oh no, you have to have more.
here's another one.
that would go here and that spells mom.
oh, I see.
do you think it really does, Adam?
well, put them all on.
that's an hl for horse.
I thought they were hl-s.

no.
what is it?
oh, you had some on the back of yours too?
he was giving it to you, Adam.
can you put it up there, Adam?
now these we have to be very careful with.
you have to be very careful with them and write only on paper.
he was giving you something, Adam, that he found.
yes, it's good to make sure you put the cover back on.
isn't this it?
here it is.
no no, this is for Adam.

these are puppets.
these kangaroos are in there.
that's a dragon.
what do you think?
I don't know.
who?
no, here's his face.
then they couldn't see.
now it's night time.
they have to go back.
first they go for a boat ride.
here're the boats.
oh, this side, yeah.
this is the fair and this is where they live.
that's a good idea, isn't it?
but they could walk across the bridge.
now were you going to find me a scissors?
you read that one to me if you like.
well, that's what I need the scissors for.
we can make very nice designs with it if we cut some paper to go on
we have to have scissors to cut it out.
really?
how do you know that's the kind he likes?
let's use this one.
we need a circle just that size.
a circle just that size.
thank you.
I'll trim it just a bit.
that's very nice.
yes, it's sort of an egg shape.
now, Adam, let's start, I cut this way.
you turn this.
I'll hold this down.
you turn it.
whoops, not too fast.
you can turn it over and do a different one.
yes.
lots of different things.
not too fast.
a head of a turtle?
now you can set this in different places and see what it does.
each time you move it it gets a different design.
I don't think it'll write your name but it'll make lots of different
alright, try.
what?
until this writes your name?
it might do something surprising.
let's make another piece of paper alright?
alright.
it's a little bit too big.
make it a tiny bit smaller.
you like that?
no, I'll think I'll bring it back.
let's make it a tiny bit smaller.
that's right.
now it's just exactly right.
it looks like a big flower.
yes.
another turtle?
no more?
not too fast.
you need to go slower with it.
isn't that pretty?
that's enough?
ok, wait, Adam.
that's right.
I think so.
let's try it.
it's a surprise.
not too fast, Adam, because it doesn't work.
is that a turtle?
no?
what is it?
the pen?
that's what makes it draw.
no, it just stays blue.
because it's a pen that's writing.
it could but then the machine wouldn't work.
alright.
try it.
alright.
do you want to cut?
start here.
alright.
put it on.
no, I think I'll cut it now.
yes.
just a minute.
is that your favorite?
oh, is that alright?
what happened?
oh, that's a good one, Adam.
no, just one.
shall we trim it just a little bit?
alright.
shall I draw where you cut it?
alright.
remember to go very slow when you're turning.
so you can get a turtle in the middle.
now you can change it.
silly!
I didn't think you were calling anyone silly, were you?
that's what I thought.
try it like that.
that?
that makes it wavy.
it makes it wavy like on the ocean.
alright.
alright.
it's hard to hold it, isn't it?
sure.
I could draw around it.
would that make it any easier?
and you could cut on the line.
that's good.
yes.
it's pretty good.
which way?
oh yes.
there's one more piece here.
alright.
try them all.
push it down.
ok.
right.
is that what you call slow?
that isn't slow.
alright.
I'm not ready.
whoops.
you can keep those.
just be sure you don't get it on
do it on the newspaper.
ok, Adam?
what?
press it straight down on the stamp pad.
it says six five four two zero seven.
it says the same.
you can change the numbers.
well, you have to put it back in the ink gently.
six five four one nine seven.
six five four three eight.
six five four three eight.
what do you think?
keep your fingers off.
what does that say?
which one?
seven five four two zero seven.
yes.
from all of those on the bottom.
right.
did you go to school yesterday, Adam?
no?
what did you get?
what kind of something, a present?
you don't know what you got?
you don't like it?
that's all I've got.
do you know what that is?
I bet you know.
you know how to use it.
that's good.
that's it.
maybe it needs to be a little longer for you.
for Robin.
mmhm.
I know you are.
right.
which friend?
oh, at school?
how can you have too much?
think you could jump better if I tie your shoes?
no?
I think so.
let me try.
hmm?
is it?
I can't right now.
I have to go back up to see if Paul and Diandra are alright.
to see if you and Ursula were alright.
are you finished with that?
oh, would you like to play with them?
oh, that's dry Jello.
I think maybe some little boy I know put it in.
what little boy do you think?
would it be you?
then who would it be?
no.
David or else?
could be Robin.
how could Robin do that?
he just opens up a package of Jello.
mmhm.
it's a toy clock.
oh.
don't knock on the window, Adam.
huh?
careful.
Paul is right behind you.
no no, don't push.
no no, don't push.
so you can call another fire department and say come to thirty two
we need some help.
Adam, shall I strap it on for you?
Adam, let's not play that way, Diandra, don't do it now.
you can press the button on that microphone.
see what happens.
talk, Adam.
don't pretend like that.
then he willn't try to talk if you don't talk properly.
Diandra, Paul had that.
Adam, do you want to see some of the things I brought?
you are?
a fire engine?
a fireman, oh, I see.

I think you have to look toward the light.
oh, that's nice.
let Paul see it, please.
alright, Paul, you don't have to look.

let Paul see this one.

I haven't seen her since she was a puppy.
I saw her when she was a puppy, but not since then.
yes.
oh yes, they can, but it doesn't hurt very much.
yes.
I didn't know you had scissors fingers.
how did you?
yes.
do you want another piece, Adam?
here's another piece.
I don't know.
I bet you're sitting on it.
how can you draw it quick if you really want to draw something?
yes.
no, is she on it too?
draw a dog on the merrygoround.
you're going too fast.
go get the other piece.
no, there're two piece there.
Adam will give it to you.
uhhuh.
well, he's learning.
oh no, I'm just getting sort of dizzy.
yes, thank you.
just one more.
stop.
stop, stop, I want to get off.

what is the funniest bird you ever saw?
yes.
cut the what off?
the points.
do you know how to say please, Adam Smith?
now let's see if you can say the other magic word?
no, I'd like to go on a ferris wheel.
yes, I am.
yes.
why're you getting another chair?
the rollercoaster.
I'll drive one of those cars.
that they have at the carnival that you get in and drive.
I didn't mean the boat cars but you can ride in them.
yes, I am.
I like to ride on the boat.
did you have a story about that at school?
of all the things at the carnival?
how do you know what we find at the carnival?
oh, you have some friends who know a lot.
who are those friends?
oh, I wouldn't think so.
well, why don't you let Paul play with it while you're doing that?
well, you give me the scissors and I'll let Paul cut some.
well, this just what you didn't want.
now what?
that looks like a
is that an eagle?
is that an eagle?
is it a crow?
is that an owl?
it's an owl.
is that a lion?
is it a cow?

Adam Smith, those are ducks.
hen?

oh, I see.
if a cat's baby is called a kitten what's a dog's baby called?
no, listen.
if a cat's baby is called a kitten then what is a dog's baby
what's a baby dog?
a kitten?
a cat?
a dog, Rinny could be the mother of a cat?
does that say oinko oinko or baao baao?
Paul, what says oinko oinko?
what says quacko?
what is that?
no, dear, that's his.
you wouldn't let him play with the puzzle.
yes, he can.
Adam, what's your dirty undershirt doing in here?
what is that?
I don't have any juice today I'm sorry.
I think so.
you had milk today at school.
that Adam that went to school?
you what?
oh, what's his name?
you mean there's another Adam.
that's a barn.
what is what?
alright.
why don't you turn your chair around so I can see.
aren't you nice, thank you.
that is a cl al tl.
under the chair.
four?
I see them.
those aren't they?
where did they go then?
what?
what do I see that begins with hl like Hercules?
huh?
uhhuh.
no, not Hercules but hl.
why?
is that the way you talk at school?
no.
so she'll remember what we're all saying.
what a nice barn, Adam.
no, but I'd like to see how it works.
would you show her?
she means how you play with it.
what happens to the barn?
it doesn't have any batteries.
yes, why don't you show Ursula the animal set that lives in the
I didn't see any bag.
I guess I'm hiding it.
yes.
oh, let's see what else there is.
here's a book.
this is the man who wrote the book.
after the glamour of yesterday nothing is quite good enough.
there's a punch in the bag.
alright.
that's what that paper was for.
you what, Adam?
what's her name?
oh, really?
what are you doing?
I see a tree.
a butterfly.
now it's a what?
see dat?
you could do it if you fold the paper.
well, you have to fold right near where you want to go.
oh yes, it looks like a footprint.
I see a balloon.
a balloon with a string.
no place.
I just came out here for a little while.
alright?
when you want me you call me.
play checks, let me see.
that's a real ticket.
that's a real one.
yes, it is.
let me see the date.
February twenty fourth.
that was yesterday.
how do you know when it's tomorrow?
Adam, how do you know when it's tomorrow?
you know what time?
no.
it's eleven fifteen.
nearly.
how do you know when it's morning or afternoon?
a what?
a wing?
how do you know if it's night or day?
I just wondered.
where is your watch?
you're not going to show me?
why not?
a striped watch?
I've never seen a striped watch.
I've never seen one.
I thought you said you had one.
a what boy?
a no boy with no watch?
you made it big.
it's much bigger.
it's much smaller too!
how could it be both?
that's right.
I do.
I have two tricky boys of my own.
sure.
I like you, a tricky boy.
is it getting smaller?
you could make a mask.
you can cut two big round holes for eyes and one for the nose
then it would be a mask.
shall I draw them darker?
could I have the pencil?
that's going to be a big job.
a church?
what does your church have?
on top?
where?
on the bottom of the church?
sure, will you give it back?
I can't tell.
can you tell?
just because he's crying?
does that always mean he's bad?
yes.
I can't tell.
how can you tell?
but does he only cry when he's naughty?
doesn't he cry other times?
but is that the same as naughty?
so you can't tell.
I think you're a funny boy.
you're a funny boy.
a lobster eating?
that's a punch.
what?
yes, it is a punch.
alright.
that would be nice.
you don't want Paul to get caught?
you just punch two holes on the sides.
one there and one on the other side.
oh yes, I see one that looks like a lollipop.
you could lick it, but don't .
just pretend, right?
no.
it willn't hurt you that much.
it isn't that bad.
alright.
still see the what?
get them over to the front, that's right.
yes.
right.
you did it yesterday, didn't you?
it's just jumping out.
when you want to shoot you first pull this and then pull this.
you push this.
there are always some more.
yeah.
oh, did you get them all?
good for you.
shall I help you?
pull this and then this.
pull that back.
now do this.
yes.
yes, and then through one of those holes and you have a score.
yes.
let's see.
that's got a score on it.
can you read numbers?
what number is that?
this is ten.
and this is twenty five.
this is fifty.
and this is seventy five.
you what?
what?
like a snowman.
are you able to make it work?
now pull that back.
this.
squeeze it.
and now pull this one.
squeeze this all the way back.
yes.
that's it.
the lights are off.
do you think they're going to sleep?
I didn't know he could reach it.
did they go?
yes.
uhhuh.
would you like to play with this?
you need a string or a shoelace, remember?
what, the gun?
doesn't it spin for long time?
Adam, do you want to hang up the clothes line?
let me see who's taller.
Adam's taller.
oh no, you willn't want any dinner.
I'd like to sit in this chair if it's alright with you.
would you like to put up the clothesline?
maybe one end could go on the drawer.
where're you going to tie the other end?
you can tie it, go ahead.
if you can't tie it maybe Robin can tie it.
alright.
Ursula brought it for Adam to play with.
alright.
let me see if there's something you can hang in the box.
your line is slipping down.
what can you do about that?
Robin, show him.
yes, somebody started making that.
maybe you could both work on this one.
oh, here's a watch.
here, Adam.
what?
Ursula tore it.
you can really wear this.
this is hard to do.
he's in the first grade.
here, Adam, here's yours.
this is a pill box.
scrap.
what's a scrap?
a medicine?
what kind of medicine is it?
Robin, what does that sign say?
why?
what letters are those like that?
sounds serious.
looks like someone's what?
what?
dead!
three boys.
don't you see three?
no!
count the boys.
you could give me a shot.
ow.
here's some medicine.
oh, what is that?
what is it?
bend it.
not bullets.
it shoots medicine.
or vaccines.
yes.
mmhm.
and you have to put it around her head.
too heavy?
yes.
Diandra, here's your book, dear.
see, Robin can read.
when you start going to school you can read too.
oh, that's for the doctor.
here, Adam, here's the cap.
alright.
what do you think that is?
what is this do you think?
you're going to give me a shot.
would you come here and be fitted, Adam?
look in the mirror, Adam.
you can't see it?
Robin told you.
operating room.
maybe you could hang it on the line.
are you going to operate?
waiting?
oh, what does the sign say?
did you tell Robin that you went to his house?
and you saw some toys of his.
you saw his tricycle.
what else did you see?
why three children?
two bikes?
oh, you mean big bicycles.
Adam, you're right.
there were three.
no, she has only has two children.
three bikes, but two children.
and we have three children and two bikes.
that's right.
it's so hard.
Adam, did you go to school this morning?
yes.
we see Underdog.
what?
I think so.
I think that's the bottom of the pill box.
Mommy.
that's a horse.
oh.
oh yes, what is that?
you have to pin it on.
there are some holes.
could I have another page?
I thought you said you could read it.
oh, you have too much work to do?
oh, that's good.
oh, how nice.
but I think you should give some to Ursula.
you think there's a what?
oh, I'm sorry.
a vase, oh.
yes, I heard you, thank you.
you're going to talk to me?
well, maybe you should stay away so you willn't trip.
well, you should stay away.
oh, Adam, why don't you give them to Robin and then he can give
then both mothers will have flowers, right?
well, you gave them to me.
and then I gave them back to you.
now you can give them to Robin and he can give them to his mother
I'll give them back now Adam.
where's the box?
that's not a box.
it's supposed to be a case.
what?
well then, I guess the nurses would have to take care of people.
then maybe each person would have to take care of himself.
alright.
don't take his things, Adam.
here you are, Adam.
you can't even what?
they're cotton balls.
for cleaning things.
if you have a hurt or scratch or cut you can clean it with a ball of cotton.
Diandra, why are you tearing it up?
that's right.
what time is it, Adam?
oh dear.
maybe you should keep the things we want to keep away from there.
Diandra, no.
you're tearing up too much.
that wouldn't be nice to do.
would you like for me to leave you down here without any dinner?
that's another pill box.
it's a little tiny pill.
Diandra, no more, dear.
you're just tearing up too much paper.
oh, did he say what I said?
it's a pill box.
yes.
no?
give you out?
what does that mean?
oh, I should give you out and that means spank you?
you're giving me a shot to make me feel better?
ah.
what's wrong, doctor?
no, he thinks you're checking him too.
the things you need that the doctor uses.
it's a supply cabinet, isn't it?
I don't think you put the medicine in there.
I think you put the tongue depressor in there and other things like
I don't think so.
that's for taking medicine.
no, liquid medicine.
do you have a bottle of medicine?
you need to do what?
rash?
what kind of rash?
oh, I see you put some medicine on my hand and washed it off?
he's taking a rash off my hand.
that's cotton on the end of a stick for pretending to clean your
is it real?
no.
is that a sick doggie?
close the door, please.
no, all the way.
so we can hear better.
what?
on what, dear?
I don't think that's a pill, is it?
I'm trying to fix it.
I think we need a little bit of Scotch tape.
I don't think so.
Adam, don't sit on that.
it's not.
oh, did the baby cry?
she's not a crybaby?
can you try it yourself?
shorter than I am?
Adam, do you want to see the film that Ursula took the other day?
do you want to see a cartoon?
would you like to look in this box, Adam?
you look like you're excited.
they call it a film viewer or film editor.
you look like you're excited.
they call it a film viewer or film editor.
viewer?
can you wind that?
I know you are.
will that cord reach?
do you want me to plug it in?
how does this work?
that's the handle to turn the film.
do you?
there we are.
this one is a Popeye film.
alright.
where're you going?
not yet.
maybe we can close the curtains.
if the room is dark we can see it better.
that looks like for what?
oh, for boys and kids.
I think that was Abbott and Costello.
we'll have to take the film off to have an empty reel.
I think we'll just do it to this one.
who's crying?
is it Diandra or Paul?
do you know all about this?
yes.
well, you can see it right here at home.
once we get it on she can see it.
there's a button on the side that turns the light on.
you are not, are you?
this is a little bit tricky.
yes, it is.
now we're getting there.
do you have a bad cold, Adam?
turn this light on on the side.
push it forward.
alright.
you eat spinach too?
yes.
there we go.
there's the Popeye movie.
there's a lady with lots of children.
oh, she has a lot of children.
how many does she have?
eight!
eight children!
are they boys or girls?
all boys?
my goodness.
do you want to see where they bump their heads?
they both are bowing before her and they bumped their heads.
they're both pulling her.
she's going to break in half.
looks like it.
what did he do?
I think you're right.
want ta see them run backwards?
alright.
what's happening now?
look, she's stuck on a tree.
poor Olive, she's tied in a knot.
Adam, you can rewind that one, alright.
yes, go all the way backwards, that's right.
let's see what we find in this one.
these will be pictures of Robin and David and their friends and
I wouldn't think so.
do you want to turn the button on, Adam?
this is a halloween parade.
there's somebody in a white shirt.
who does that look like?
doesn't it?
Adam's not interested in this.
there's something recognizable.
alright, we'll go back to cartoons, alright?
do you want to see Popeye?
Adam, would you like to do the turning?
well, why don't you do it?
you want to see it.
this is going to be Popeye.
two?
no, you turn it for me.
let me see it.
what happened?
that many?
oh no.
I'd probably forget their names.
is he going to buy a ring?
with what on her nose?
oh.
what happened?
how do you think you have to do it?
oh, I want to see it.
oh, you got to the end.
you never heard of what?
oh, I've seen some.
I have one more comedy if you want one.
why is it dangerous?
does it go in this box?
yes, this is Popeye.
that's alright it is, Adam.
no, wait, don't do that.
would you like one more?
we can do that one we unwound.
yes.
wait, no, don't pull it, Adam.
you'll break it.
I'm not sure, Adam.
where is that?
oh yes.
yes, I'm your mother too.
I'm not quite sure.
no, wait, wait.
why would you do that?
out out out.
no no.
we have to leave it down in the box.
alright?
alright, Adam.
you may wind some more.
ok.
can you stop now and look at the picture?
what's that doing?
did they fall off yet?
hold still.
stop.
we have to straighten the film.
who was scared?
oh, the man on the building.
you're not scared of anything?
goodness, you're a brave little boy.
that you're not afraid.
what animals?
you're afraid of a starfish?
they're animals, I guess.
yes, they're real.
alright, would you like to turn more?
ok.
hold still.
stop, stop, stop.
what're you doing with my box?
that's the what?
don't you think it might be a little too large to go on there?
oh, you're ready for some more film.
they fall off yet?
you told your skin to stop.
no no, let me do it.
you may break it, dear.
alright.
oops.
what happened?
wait.
alright.
I guess he wants to go on there too.
thank you.
alright, Adam.
can you turn it off?
what is it a picture of?
because I like to sit there.
alright.
can you unplug it, Adam?
I'm sorry.
no no, you have to turn it off and then unplug it.
because when you turn it off you cut the current off and then you
it could.
not when it's off.
that's a very nice boy, Adam.
like this.
it's already down.
that's a very nice neat boy, Adam Smith.
are you sleepy, Adam?
what color is that?
what color is that?
what color is that?
are those two red?
with only one stripe?
is Robin going to have a turn?
what?
any way you wish, dear.
I don't think I'd like either one, thank you.
I don't think that's exactly right.
thank you, that's exactly right.
the other children are asleep?
oh, a strike.
how many did you knock down?
well, that was fast.
maybe you'd like to build with Robin.
here's the ball.
where's the other bowling ball?
oh yes, you can.
it's hard.
oh yes.
just blow very hard.
I think you could blow it, Adam.
oh no, I'm sure that's not hard to do at all, dear.
try it.
no, I can't .
just like you blew up the duck.
you watch and see how Robin does it.
there it comes, see?
there it is.
it will take time, it has to grow.
alright.
it looks like an oldfashioned light bulb.
smoking a peace pipe.
that's right.
but you're losing too much air.
try to get the air down through the hole.
you blow and let me go get Paul and Diandra.
now it looks like a street light.
what do you think it looks like?
yours looks like a dirigible, the kind of balloon people used to
is it made of marble?
no, probably something like rubber.
no, it's just very big.
bigger than this room.
yes, that balloon is strong.
do you want to make a little bigger?
enough?
I'm going to take a little air out of mine.
how did he do it?
I don't think that's how.
try it.
I think you could.
it's easier the second time.
keep your mouth tight around the pipe.
this long stem.
what do you call it?
no.
it's plastic.
what do you think the balloon is made of?
made of what?
I think they get it inside of certain trees in South America.
rubber.
to make tires and balloons and rubber bands.
no, they're rubber.
what?
you could play it with Robin.
how do you play it?
if you see what?
you just made that up.
stamps?
no, he means paper clips.
paper clips.
those are made out of metal.
no, balloons are made out of rubber.
are made out of wood.
and what does wood come from?
uhhuh.
metal comes from under the ground.
under the ground.
if you have a quarter you can change it into two dimes.
how do you think they make dollars?
out of paper.
they draw on it.
paint on it.
can't draw what?
Pete?
I don't know.
a name.
of somebody.
I don't know.
I know a boy named Peter, is that what you mean?
did you have a different Adam at school today?
you told me about one last time.
no?
never?
sure.
that's Robin.
you tell him where.
it has to be in this room though.
well, you have to hide.
did he find you or somebody else?
how come Rinny's so quiet?
ok.
Robin's .
Robin, give Diandra his balloon.
what, Adam?
do you remember where you played with them?
where the what?
mmhm.
mmhm.
the doorway.
no, what?
Adam, could you show us where's the bathroom?
don't go in the bathroom, dear if somebody's in it.
that looks pretty, Adam.
the road?
that's a building block to the house.
that can go wherever you want.
it does.
I think we willn't open that yet.
maybe next time.
no, I think we have enough things out for now.
yes.
mmhm.
an umbrella?
a pair of glasses?
clock?
a fishing rod?
get off what?
did you say.
get off, I'm at the farm.
oh, isn't that nice.
that's a long one, Adam.
long fishing rod.
what did Robin make, Adam?
is that a horse or a dog?
a dog.
Robin, how's your kitty?
good.
it gets into lots of trouble.
do you know what that kitty does when I clean house?
whenever I'm sweeping the kitty lands right in the dirt.
right now?
the kitty's home sleeping.
she's waiting for everyone to come home, Adam.
she goes to sleep all day while we're not there.
she doesn't want to be tired when they do get home.
what kind of fish are you going to get?
what kind of fish is that?
ask him.
no.
mmhm.
the car that I have now.
I think that's marvelous.
it means I think it's very very very nice.
did you know her father is Robin's grandfather?
yes.
I'm getting all wet.
why, Adam?
pretty soon but not yet.
you can hardly wait.
yes, now you can.
Adam, for that we need a tray.
let's do it right over here, Adam.
I know we need a little saucer or dish to pour some in.
I'm not sure it's wide enough.
she's coming back.
he doesn't what?
he doesn't want me to take care of him?
you, oh.
oh, I don't think they would, though, would they?
let me have the cover back.
let me have the cover.
turn this upside down, dip it in and then blow.
do it very flat so it touches all the way around.
blow again. you have to blow out and then take it out of your mouth and breathe.
may I do one?
blow through it.
you're finished with it.
already?
yes, it seems a little too quick.
well, Adam.
if you're finished with it you better pour it back into the jar.
are you really ready?
blow, Adam.
try it again.
do you think those are pretty?
that's right.
good.
let's give Paul another try.
I know but it's sticky.
mmhm.
want me to help you with it?
now if you open it you have to play with it.
you can't just open it and look at it and say.
I'm all finished.
who's hungry?
well, you have to ask her first.
yes, and maybe you can share them with other people.
why don't you close the box and put the box up because you can't eat
you can only have two.
you may give Paul and Diandra another one.
no, one for Paul and one for Diandra and then put them up.
alright.
well, close the box and put the box back in.
Diandra.
put the box back in the bag.
no, he willn't spill them.
wait, Adam, don't break it now.
let's see what happens.
it's on plus.
that means it's going to add.
you're going to add the numbers together?
no, that's not right.
what are those numbers?
don't leave them spread out over the floor, the little boys might
alright.
get over on the floor.
your favorite what?
you just took them out.
no no, Adam, now that's not the way you got them.
pick that up.
yes, it is very easy to pick up.
that's why there should be none of it left.
there it is, under the chair.
I don't see how you could be finished so soon.
see if there's a pad of paper in my bag.
Adam Smith.
alright.
maybe there isn't one.
you can use this.
what did you say?
I don't know.
oh, I'm sorry.
oh, that means marvelous.
marvelous means that?
you did.
what did you dream?
no, Diandra, you're not to play with the crayons. maybe you could draw something, Adam.
do you suppose you could draw some flowers?
spring flowers?
oh, it's very nice.
I think I put them up on the mantle there.
yes, I heard about that.
first grade, just like Robin is in.
what?
no, but he's in the first grade in a different school.
oh, that's not nice to say.
what does feather brain mean?
oh.
because Indians have feathers around their brains?
hello, you didn't have enough rest today, did you?
you didn't have enough of a nap.
is that what happened?
oh?
well, you should not have watched it.
why don't you use that other paper on the back for a stem.
oh, what did you write?
could you read it to me?
oh, marvelous.
I'm sorry.
yes, I did forget.
oh, what is that?
give it to Adam.
no no, that's Adam's .
what?
what're you going to do?
no, Diandra, that's his flower.
what?
the wizzyc lion, I don't know what that is.
who is that?
the line?
the what?
oh, Reggie.
oh, did you draw the stem on that one?
can you say thank you?
thank you.
what color do you think he should color it?
alright.
he said you may color it.
what is your favorite color?
what color is that?
oh, Adam.
you're welcome.
Adam, you knocked your crayons across the floor.
that is pretty.
Diandra, do you want to take a breath?
no.
you didn't draw a stem.
why don't you cut a stem?
here's a piece of paper.
use the side of this for a stem.
what will she have to write on?
didn't I bring some paper home to you?
what do you want?
what?
well, give that to me and I'll give that to Paul.
be quiet now.
draw on your paper.
that's nice.
what did you say, Adam?
is this yours?
is this yours?
oh, I'm sorry.
Mommy.
Mommy.
how?
how?
how what?
how would you what, Adam?
what's freesofc?
what's freesofc?
oh, Adam, he has to be saying something.
Diandra, you just color for a few minutes.
Mommy.
Mommy.
what're you making, Adam?
what happens when we go to sleep?
are you going to give me a lesson in making flowers?
what is that, Adam?
look under your paper.
are you sitting on them?
car.
cars, yes.
car truck.
car truck.
that's a nice color.
that's hard, isn't it?
oh, isn't this nice, Adam.
where can I find a piece of scissors?
will you two please stop?
what a nice lot of flowers you've got.
truck.
do you have a long stem on there?
how would that help?
no, I think you do.
Diandra, no no.
get away from the tape recorder, dear before you knock it over.
that's right.
I don't understand how she understands anything anyway.
I think perhaps we're going to have to take Paul and Diandra outside
Adam, these are really very nice flowers.
how many cars do you have?
sneezy.
how could your hair get sneezy?
do you make flowers like that at school?
that lady that sleepedn
maybe that's a babysitter who went to sleep.
oh, she stayed when I was sick.
you could see what else is in the bag.
there's one other thing.
under your sweater.
remember we made these beautiful flowers?
it's a worm?
what is, Adam?
are you finished?
here.
let's do it on top of the newspaper.
how?
yes, because it's inky.
remember to put de cover on.
because it get dry.
that's very pretty.
yes.
what do you think?
hmm?
baseball?
put the cover back on, Adam.
what kind of color is that?
what do you think?
it has a tip.
mmhm.
what are you writing?
put the cover back on.
twist it.
may I try?
here, Adam.
I'm afraid I don't have any juice but you may have a banana.
you may give Robin a banana and Ursula a banana if you like to.
yes.
what?
what?
I forgot to say that you could have a banana?
I didn't .
I said, Adam, you could have a banana and offer Robin and Ursula one
don't forget the cover, Adam over under the chair.
not very well.
Robin, would you give him a few pieces of paper.
sure.
in case you want to carry it with you.
you didn't put the top back on the yellow.
you hold this down.
take a test.
what kind of test?
oh.
will you make a picture of me too?
alright.
you'd love to be a banana monkey?
what?
do you want to use another color?
don't forget the top.
look.
it's behind the crayons.
here's the red.
I'll blast it off for you.
what happened?
is that the baby fish.
what's your favorite color?
a spider.
a rainbow.
is it?
a snail.
a shell.
it is?
you find shells in the bottom of the sea.
you could.
you don't want a fish what?
you could wear a suit to cover you all up.
to go under the water.
that's what divers do.
I saw a movie about it.
about men who lived under the sea for three months.
how could they?
they didn't have enough air.
they took their air along with them in tanks, they made their own
they went down and explored the bottom.
I could show you some pictures of that movie.
ok.
alright.
Robin, would you give him some more?
do you want me to do it?
Adam, let's take off one cover at a time, alright?
no, one at a time.
is that the air tank?
they're all covered in suits.
so they don't get wet and they have a plastic thing so even the
it's round and you can see through it like a
like a helmet but it covers the face so you wouldn't get wet.
no.
for going under water, it doesn't have holes in it so you don't get
you're making him all wet.
good.
here's a color.
what's base?
oh.
something like gloves.
something like boots but like a suit that covers him everywhere.
they're already here.
yes.
they're up there by my purse.
good for you, for putting all the tops on, Adam.
my, you're hungry.
I might just save mine.
mmhm.
I'm not hungry just now.
are you?
really?
can you make some fish under the water?
here it is, right under your knee.
it's still under your knee.
try again.
is that a test.
that's not a test.
you can take that out to play with.
you can surprise your Mother.
she willn't know what's in there.
would you like some more banana, Adam?
open it up and take half.
I'll show you how much is half.
I don't think so.
you really think so.
let's see what else is in my bag.
you want to look at the little book.
no, didn't you see them before?
are you going to finish making yours?
alright.
who's the teacher?
do you know you can bend that mirror?
how do you look bent?
don't you like the mirror?
let me see if it needs cleaning.
it does.
three legs?
no, I'm just using a handkerchief.
oh, isn't that pretty.
what is that?
is it an apple?
is it something you eat?
is it a hat?
do I know anything like it?
alright.
I give up.
isn't that pretty.
oh.
isn't it nice.
I don't like myself very much.
how do you like yourself?
is there green?
how did you open it when I wasn't in here?
Mrs Ursula opened it?
Mr, come on, Adam.
Diandra, see yourself in there?
write a story for us.
Adam, why don't you write your name.
you're not a little what?
she'll be surprised.
do you want to use the newspaper?
I've never seen your name written like that.
where's the al?
I only see your name one time.
all the other times your name is all wrong.
Adam, put your paper on the newspaper.
just use one piece at a time.
and you didn't tear it off properly.
Mommy.
Mommy.
where are you going?
then you'll be here all by yourself.
would you give him a little piece?
that not David.
that Robin.
what're you making, Adam?
have you finished with this one?
oh no, not yet.
I didn't have enough boxes.
it's a dollar, sing.
Adam, what're you making?
could you give us a piece of paper, please?
it could be the result of a fire but
keep coloring on the back.
that's very nice.
that very nice.
did Robin make that?
why not?
oh, is that Adam's name?
let's bring everything over here.
what happened to all the crayons?
invisible!
I don't think so.
and I'll take Paul and Diandra.
we talked about it and you said that Mommy could go.
I'll be back shortly.
leave Paul here?
well, Paul will probably cry and then Ursula couldn't hear the tape
alright, Paul, here's one for you.
Adam, you want to first look here to see all the different kinds of
no, that's the top.
that's the part.
these are the things that you build with, see, because they rest on
no no.
Adamy, don't do that.
they aren't swords.
what?
let's see you build it.
it seems to me you place these long ones on top of one another.
Paul, we might have to go upstairs, hmm?
what's this?
those are building blocks.
well, this is Paul's .
he wants to build.
they look like beds.
there are no written directions.
there's just building there.
and you can make your building just like it by just looking at it.
you don't have what?
please, let him have some, dear.
Adam, let him have some, please.
look behind you, Diandra.
I think I better take you out.
can you build something on there, Adam?
there's something started.
can you find another piece like this, Adam?
are there any more big ones?
let him have some of the little ones, Adam.
you can have some too.
you use these.
put some little ones in between and then it stays better.
yes, now you can put another long piece on.
yes.
careful it doesn't fall down.
now you do the other side.
why is it naughty?
he can take some.
no, he's not.
looks like a what?
that's a rooftop.
here, Diandra.
let's give him a few more.
let's see if we can't make it stand up.
I guess that one's too small, let's put a bigger one on.
did you go to school today?
with who?
you want to put that one on?
what's the matter?
your shoe is untied?
good and then you can put a roof on.
oh yes.
what're you doing?
that looks high enough, Adam.
are they both the same so you can put a roof on?
I think this needs to be one higher.
no, Diandra, you use those.
carefully.
very carefully.
what're you going to do with them.
maybe you could make a floor.
look at your building and see.
oh, we should make some steps.
that's a good idea.
it wouldn't be so hard to make steps.
what?
oh yes.
you could have an open house and walk in.
then you don't need doors and windows but you do need steps.
I don't think so.
now where we live.
what?
maybe this house is way out in the country.
are you going to have any furniture in the house?
furniture.
who is going to sleep in the beds.
me!
I'm too big.
alright.
Adam, do you know what he's saying?
not higher than the roof?
how could you sleep higher than the roof?
I thought we're pretending I'm small.
it's a bunk bed.
is everything alright?
I'm going upstairs because Paul really is very cranky this afternoon
you didn't make a gate.
a fence.
you need two straight pieces.
and a lot of little pieces.
I think they have to be the double kind.
the fat kind.
like that.
that's a good idea.
we'll do that next.
right on top.
oh, that looks good.
shall we make a fence all around the house?
ok.
now you'll be safe.
why don't move that over because that might not go over the.
the fence?
thank you.
isn't that a pretty fence?
mmhm.
ok.
we'll fix that, Adam, that's not too hard to fix.
not too hard.
here.
a mouse!
a mouse can't eat me.
I'll eat the mouse.
it is not.
did you see any pictures of the circus.
have you been to the circus?
now we need one more side.
oh, that's so pretty, Adam.
now you could fix up the house again and put the roof on.
it doesn't need a floor.
does it need a roof?
maybe it doesn't .
yes, that's right and that could be the water.
you can pretend.
make another one and we'll have a race.
alright.
the boat knocked down a house.
let's put everything back first.
will you help Diandra?
I didn't bring the top.
I have my car just outside.
it doesn't take very long to get from here to the car.
yes, it does.
it takes very long from Harvard.
that's where you used to live.
I live near there.
I'm in the same place.
is that yours?
does Diandra have one too?
apple, Mommy.
did you finish yours already?
are they all picked up?
alright.
then maybe Diandra can play with it next.
why don't you let Diandra play with the windmill and we'll put this
Diandra's your mother!
alright.
be very careful.
submarine?
bless you.
it should.
it's supposed to.
alright.
maybe it's a jet.
yes.
yes.
no.
but this is peace time.
peace time means there's no war.
yes.
make it go high.
let's see if there's something else to do on it.
good for you, Diandra.
this makes it fly straight, I think.
oh, that's good.
it made a loop.
oh yes.
I see.
what's that, Paul?
no, let him look at it.
it says.
all controls.
I don't think there is one.
oh yes.
I don't think so.
Adam, close the door, please.
thank you, Adam.
no, Diandra.
seems you haven't finished playing with that.
well, put it back in the bag.
no, in the bag where you got it.
it wasn't in the basket.
yes.
you could draw on it.
alright.
you look in there and I'll look in here.
I don't know what's in that bag, Adam.
what is it?
some what?
some what things?
is there anything else in that bag?
let's sort them out.
looks like a corkscrew, doesn't it?
I had some spaghetti like a corkscrew.
yes.
this kind.
and then I had some
I'll see if I can make the shape.
I had some like this.
did you ever have that?
cereals?
you mean Rocky and Bullwinkle have them?
no.
you mean Rocky the squirrel?
you mean Rocky?
I don't see television very often so I guess I don't know.
yes, I can.
I just don't know about Rocky.
let's see, what shall we make?
can you?
shall I make one for you?
what's that?
is that your brother?
which finger do you want it on?
is it too tight?
do you want me to fix it?
it is too tight.
how about this way?
oh, what's that?
let's put up a block so it doesn't go too far.
I don't know where.
it looks like he's heading for the chair leg.
do you want a ring for your other hand?
will you make me a ring?
that's the right way.
no, I don't .
an airplane?
a balloon?
a lasso.
because you gave me a hint.
here, see if this fits your other finger.
ouch.
ouch.
I'm not used to sitting on the floor.
do you want more?
like Ringo.
you know who Ringo is?
one of the Beatles.
make a what kind of spear?
mmhm.
what else shall I make?
another ring?
really?
my car is broken.
how come you know I didn't bring my car?
did you look out the window and see that it isn't there?
my car doesn't work anymore.
it willn't start at all.
what?
shall I?
what color?
that would be pretty.
do you want another one?
I could make one for every finger if you want.
one more?
oh, one for me.
were you at school?
of course?
who's Kris?
is she a special friend?
I guess I made it too small.
that's very nice, Adam.
that's a beautiful bow.
look at those colors.
here's your bow.
I don't think I do, do you?
a bigger one, no, I don't .
how?
what's the difference between a spear and an arrow?
what about the arrow?
that's a very funny thing.
you could hang it from the ceiling.
shall I make you a necklace?
a gun.
I certainly don't .
that's a bicycle.
a big truck.
me too.
sounds like a motorscooter to me.
what would a lion be doing on your street?
I would care.
I wouldn't mind if a monkey wakes me up.
if a what?
car?
oh.
yes, I don't like a clock to wake me up but I don't mind monkeys
does your puppy wake you up?
you would.
I'll take them off.
we can make some flowers.
in your yard?
did you plant them?
can I see them from here?
I'll see them when I go out.
no, not like this one.
I just made this one up.
you want to make some too?
oh, is that yours?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to take that.
do you go to school all day?
in the morning too?
I thought maybe you go in the morning and stay and have lunch there.
is that how it goes?
does Kris go home too?
it's a funny flower.
isn't it?
here's another one.
what happened to my flowers?
oh no, she's here.
she's upstairs talking to somebody.
must be a gun.
me too.
oh yes.
then we have to make a sprinkling can.
oh yes, I can.
alright.
let's see first how big your wrist is.
here's one.
no.
well, I can make
no.
no, I can make a hammer and a chair.
wait a minute.
I have to put this on you.
let's try.
you have to ask me when you want it off.
you're just going to keep it on?
alright.
here's your watch.
now it can't pinch you.
what time is it?
eight thirty.
that's it right there.
aren't you going to keep them on?
I'm going to keep mine on.
it comes off.
you look very elegant.
let's put them away.
I'm going to keep my ring on too.
let's leave the flowers up, alright?
are there some books in there?
do you want to look at them?
what're you going to do with the pajamas?
what does it look like?
a banjo!
let's see where it's going to fit.
doesn't your mother have one of these?
guess.
no.
guess again.
I guess this is going to fit here.
try again.
we're going to need some crackers and a bowl.
do you want to ask your mother for that?
a small bowl.
a small bowl.
let's put the crackers on here and the bowl goes here.
put a cracker in here and turn it and see what happens.
what did it make?
it's a grinder.
it grinds them up.
lots of what?
you can watch it come out here.
cracker crumbs.
you could put them back through again.
a what?
a grain thrower?
yes or else you could ask your Mother if there is anything else
it comes out like a waterfall.
I think maybe that's the last time.
watch your fingers.
what did you say, sugar?
yes, that's the one.
sure, and sheep too.
go slow.
grain fall?
I think maybe that's enough.
they do.
they taste salty and delicious.
brush yourself off.
let's see if we can rescue some of this, alright?
that means you can grind this up again.
that's a good idea.
we'll just pick it up with the paper.
look inside and see how you think it works.
where does it push it?
what way?
where does the grain go when you push it?
and then?
mm.
you could make some bread with that.
you make bread out of grain.
oh, let's take a bigger piece.
no.
careful.
you forgot something.
it'll taste like roast beef.
mm, chicken.
what does yours taste like?
chocolate!
let's make a little funnel.
pour it right in.
cheese.
grapes.
careful.
watch.
well, look what happens here.
what do you think this does when you put a cracker through there?
what do you think it does here?
how come it gets so small?
what do you think it will be like?
orange juice.
wait, Adam.
now don't forget to put the bowl back.
frost.
what's it like?
there isn't any.
stand up and we'll clean it all off again.
alright, but first I have to get it all collected.
wait for me.
don't go without me.
it's all gone.
alright.
water.
mine tastes like Pepsi_Cola.
raspberries.
it changes grain into anything you want, right?
can you make me some strawberries?
why do you have to wait till it gets older?
what kind of things do you eat that are older?
water's older?
that's right.
only it gets less every time.
oh, that's alright.
you can
we can use the flower.
who's coming down?
with the what?
what did you call it?
the grain what?
alright.
well, let's leave it up, alright?
I don't know if I have anything else.
maybe you'll have to show me some things, alright?
what do you think?
you better put those back.
the pajamas aren't to play with.
guess.
what do you think?
maybe.
I do.
cherries.
maybe I could have a drink but I can't stay for supper.
no.
why not?
we forgot to show your Mother the rings.
yes.
alright.
well, I'll take one and you take two, how's that?
what did we forget?
oh.
yes.
shall I get out the pipe cleaners?
yes.
it would grind the stick up.
yeah, but then you couldn't eat the grain anymore.
that's right, because it'll be mixed with stick.
a telescope, hmm?
I'll try.
no, thank you.
that's a good idea.
you make a chain.
a chain of flowers.
yes, it's very oldfashioned.
oldfashioned glasses?
shall we do that after the telescope?
why don't you bake some bread?
here's your telescope.
here, Diandra.
yes.
I'm making them.
oh, thank you.
I'm sorry.
that I didn't bring you down anything to eat.
well, we had all those fruits, strawberries and cherries
oh my goodness.
now I don't have to get any birthday presents.
you do?
what time is it?
oh yes, what shall I do with it?
oh, it's good.
no, thank you.
if you want to but I don't want any more.
what do you think that was?
maybe it was a police car.
how do you know how cows eat?
how do you know how cows eat?
no, thank you.
say no, thank you.
Adam.
just a minute.
where shall we put this?
you had something to eat.
did you tell her what you had in there?
buds?
oh, it's a rosebud, I guess.
yes.
would he be taller than you if you trade chairs?
just a minute.
alright.
would you like to bring your chair over here?
have you told her that you're graduating from nursery school?
his robe.
who made the hats?
oh, I didn't even know I was supposed to make your hat.
out of cardboard.
well, I saw them in her office when I took the robe in.
let's take the biggest thing first.
oh, is that the way you know that's rubber?
that was very nice of you, Adam.
I wouldn't be so sure.
let me open it.
is there a trick to opening this?
good.
try it on paper.
does it work?
it's the stamp pad.
we may have to put another drop of ink on there.
maybe a drop of water would do.
just one drop, Adam.
what?
one fillc?
you don't need much, do you?
it willn't work if you put too much on there.
one more drop.
what is that?
maybe we have to use paint.
it's too wet, isn't it?
that must be paper to print on.
you can see the outline of it.
you could print it right in the book.
yes, it is, isn't it?
yes, you can even take them apart and print them.
one what?
are those letters or numbers?
can you spell your name?
Diandra, he asked you not to touch them.
stop draw.
stop draw?
alright, draw stop.
your name is draw.
Diandra, don't say stupid.
that's not nice to say.
he said what?
well, what does that mean?
I didn't hear you say thank you.
a monster magnet.
it does, doesn't it?
why do you think it sticks?
it's the most what?
oh, it's glue.
is that why it's sticking?
it's not a magnet after all?
it's not?
it's not coming out?
I don't think it really needs water.
it probably needs a little more ink in the pan.
no no, this probably needs some more ink.
pen ink.
stamp ink.
that's not really ink.
that's the water, that's mixed in with ink.
no, I don't think you need water, dear.
on the pad, yes.
Adam, why don't you let them play with it?
come on, boys, let's go upstairs.
I don't want a cat.
I've got a dog.
I don't want to have a dog.
my dog is outside.
these are Mexican jumping beans.
he can help too.
it's right underneath the ink.
no, I guess not.
isn't that nice, Adam.
very good, Adam.
can you tie your shoes?
look in the bag.
I can feel mine jump when I hold mine in my hand.
what?
yes, I see.
without what?
my arm is too big.
let me put it on you.
how can you get out?
some more?
you haven't finished playing with these.
are you sure you want something else?
alright.
what did you find, Adam?
now, Adam, you better find yourself a a target.
you could use this for a target.
it's a dart.
aim for the target.
dart.
somebody what?
you missed.
I never what?
willn't get it.
be careful.
I have an idea what you said.
I willn't tell you.
it's a secret.
you missed the target.
no.
you almost got it.
what're you doing that for?
are you his admirer?
why don't you take that one out?
you only had two.
here it is, on the chair.
is that it on the chair?
what?
shoot at yourself?
I wouldn't do that.
that could be dangerous.
no, don't point it toward anyone.
why don't you do it over here?
hit on the black.
almost.
two more darts.
well no.
let's look at your gun.
careful, Adam.
yes.
alright.
important to who?
why don't you stick to one thing?
only the one thing, yes.
that's right.
she wants so much toys.
what will I play with when I go home?
alright.
you have to take care of what?
to do what?
stand up.
what're you supposed to be?
well, let's let Paul keep one.
do you have one, Diandra?
yes.
just like a target shall be?
is that what you said?
you're aiming some place?
a Mexican day.
yes, he can keep it.
that's right.
what?
what's wrong, Paul?
why?
a what?
no, what could you put the cans on?
a record_phonec?
you mean the record player?
maybe I can help you fasten it.
I don't think so.
no, just on the door.
no, dear, on the door.
it's easier for Mommy to keep up with the door.
let's have the door for the special place for the darts.
that's the what?
who makes the rodgerc gun?
you only call it what?
a rodgerc gun.
I don't feel like reaching way up there.
am I that tall?
am I that tall?
Mommy.
Mommy.
uhhuh.
see?
are you going to be tall enough?
promise not to do it again?
I still can't reach it.
I'm afraid that willn't be sufficient.
did it?
good.
it's not up there by glue.
no.
she said no just like I said no.
no.
it works like a plunger.
no, it's not a magnet.
why do you think it sticks?
that's not the reason.
see if you can find out why.
it's not glue.
it has air.
I surely don't .
what do you think happens when I push down?
yes, just like a plunger, that's right.
when you push down it pushes out the air underneath there.
maybe he could keep two.
can you tell me what makes that stick?
I don't talk to you like that.
it wouldn't stick, would it?
why?
the what?
the dodge?
what is the dodge?
just a minute ago you were saying it was some other kind of a gun
I don't know that I've heard of anybody with Rodger as a last name.
you didn't hit her?
are you sure?
what?
that's his nursery school teacher.
how many do you have?
get on the other side, honey.
you get on this side, Diandra.
close the door, Diandra.
a mule.
that's what the expression is.
it's something you say to
yes, you say it to a person to help explain something or add color
you could shoot at anything that's set up for a target.
oh, is that why you missed?
alright, now.
again.
again.
just right.
thank you.
don't play what yet?
you say no?
why not?
why not?
yes.
I'm going upstairs and check on Paul.
ok, now you can play it.
Adam, you're in kindergarten now, aren't you?
will you sit down over here, Adam?
pretty nice, isn't it?
ok, you want to surprise her?
where's your dog?
can I see from here without going outside?
alright.
you have a car in the back yard?
oh, there.
what does it play or sing?
it can sing to make jingle bells?
try it again.
use your finger.
oh.
did you tell Ursula about your school?
have you?
maybe one day.
when you're a little older and a little bigger.
David is eleven now.
did you try?
no.
I think so.
whatever you'd like to play.
Old_Mac_Donald.
what part of the house do you live in?
upstairs?
upstairs too?
he says he'd sharpen scissors and knives and gives you a year's guarantee.
oh, that's the lowest string.
the lowest sound.
see?
all the other ones should be higher than that.
a racing car?
where is it?
oh, I see.
but you went away for a while, didn't you?
do you want to tell me?
no, you didn't tell me anything about it.
for the sound.
maybe the hole is for the sound to come out.
that shows where to put your fingers.
do you think you're finished with the banjo?
do you know what they are?
those aren't cigarettes.
that's right.
I brought you that from Switzerland.
you can open it this way.
maybe we could do it on the table.
oh alright.
take out one piece at a time.
which piece do you want?
what do you want to make?
that's going to be nice.
goes down to what?
which ones?
you don't like those?
I do.
I like this one.
you can straighten it out.
you can roll it again.
that's right.
cheese!
will you make a sandwich?
never.
that's pretty.
you can make a man with his arms and legs and everything.
let's see.
what does he need?
no, that's not all.
now let's make a little ball and hide it inside here
now squeeze it and see what happens
now let's put a hunk of this in and see what happens, alright?
let's cover it all up, now see what happens.
nothing happens?
I think something will happen.
I think something will happen.
that's right.
let's make it all flat first.
now fold it up.
I don't think it will close if you put too many.
yes.
did you learn them in school?
did you tell Ursula what you do at school?
oh, that's delicious.
I wonder what happens if you mix these two.
what do you think it will make?
it will come off.
you can wash it off.
well, don't waste the clay.
look at that.
it's like a rainbow.
you can keep it.
that was for you.
are you?
very pretty.
oh no, thank you.
I'll just enjoy yours.
that's nice colors that you have there.
shall we make something with these?
oh how pretty.
and it lights up.
is that a real phone, Adam?
did you tell her our telephone number, Adam?
alright.
now what's our telephone number?
remember?
two six two.
one three seven eight.
I don't know.
this is a key.
the part of the what?
what kind of dog is that?
it did a little bit, see?
I thought we could make something for your doggie to eat.
what is that?
with how many legs?
I thought there were two back there.
you think the doggie would like some hotdogs?
what would the tiger like?
bananas?
a frank and a banana.
here's one banana.
here are two franks.
oh, you can do that.
you have to give him some nice strong legs to stand on.
does your tiger eat oranges?
can you make a basket?
can you make some more fruit?
alright, you make an orange, alright?
just make a little ball.
I'll make a handle for the basket.
you stretch it.
how about some grapes?
is he crying?
because you took a piece of leg?
why is he crying?
grapes.
ok.
write it on something?
how much do they cost, you tell me.
with a clock on it?
how much do they cost?
what time does the clock say?
ok.
ten cents, five cents, and one cent.
you could just stand it up.
there's a bunch of grapes.
they'll last a long time.
if you only give him two every day.
maybe he'd like an apple too.
do you?
no, I like this one, thank you.
that's right.
a what?
a carrot, of course.
oh.
you made a good one.
yes, just like you did.
you roll it and roll it.
is that right?
oh yes.
it's going to be a huge carrot.
it's going to be a huge big carrot.
yes.
over there too.
it'll get very thin.
here's your carrot.
that's as long as it can go.
I think so.
it's a snake.
isn't that the fruit basket?
no.
where?
ok.
yes.
mmhm.
can you put it in your ear?
what?
it's not.
I'm not.
why don't you play with the banjo?
I thought a banjo was all you wanted.
let's put these away first and you can have these.
alright?
alright.
you want toothpicks.
I don't know what else is in here.
careful, don't drop it.
what do you mean?
you mean on tv?
do you want to show your Mother what we made?
oh no.
can you blow?
that's all, Adam.
no, I think you've seen everything.
if she said yes it must be yes.
I bet you need what?
you do.
I didn't bring one.
I think you do need a string.
mmhm.
well, you can use a piece of my paper.
alright.
I don't have glue but I'll give you two pieces.
hold it up so Adam can see how it looks.
look at it.
you can make it.
oh, you know you can try.
I doubt that.
try.
oh.
you're making another one?
I'll go get it for you.
no.
shall I tear it for you?
what do you want me to tear?
right here?
oh alright.
what did you draw in school yesterday?
I don't understand how to play that game.
you pin those things on your back?
and then what do you do?
and then you don't let anybody look behind your back?
oh.
I have quite a ways to go.
alright.
that's not a banjo, that's a guitar.
Paul.
oh, what is it now?
oh, you changed it to what?
was it a clarinet?
oh, why don't you give her one of the ones that you had her make?
you need a better point.
let's see if we can sharpen it.
he's going to blow in the other room.
wait a minute.
wait til your mother comes in.
oh!
oh, you always want to keep something.
what was that game you were playing that I heard downstairs?
alright.
why do you do that?
the what?
show it to Mommy.
you take one and your mother takes one.
don't let it
you stay there.
you have to press the button to talk.
hello, Adam.
hello, Adam.
what are you doing?
what?
yes, Adam.
I heard you.
talking to Adam.
does it have an antenna?
yes, Adam.
where are you?
Adam.
ok.
I was in the forest.
these are nice.
I'll go out.
hello, Adam.
Rinny's outside playing.

I'm sitting on the top stair.

can you hear me?
press the button down.
what did you say?
you said.
Adam.
press the button down.
alright.
when you talk you have to press the button.
no, not with this, I don't think.
you'd have to use the telephone.
you'd probably need a bigger set.
that's just the case it came in.
don't put your mouth on it.
he'd have to have one too.
or something so he could hear you.
I don't think so.
you can go from one end of the street to the other.
go from one end of the street to the other.
ok, don't play with it, Adam.
you may break it.
well, maybe when you get a little bigger.
David's eleven years old.
no no.
you may break it.
I see a box over there.
why don't you look and see what else is in the box?
last time we went to get them they were out of them.
a game like Ursula brought for you.
alright.
oh, is that right?
you don't snap buttons, do you?
what a nice telephone bell.
we thought we'd try something different
it's so peculiar.
yes.
you don't ?
what do you think it is?
I don't think it's supposed to stick on the wall.
what else did you do in school today?
oh.
everyone else was running outside the circle.
you what?
oh, you were not in the circle.
you weren't supposed to be in the circle?
what kind of game were you playing?
oh, and left the boys in the room in a circle?
with the teacher?
maybe I'll build a Prudential Tower.
what, um
what happened to that school?
not very big but it's very tall.
peculiar.
oh, you don't mean peculiar?
how does that work out?
isn't that the way it works.

alright.

thank you.
what does that one say?
it says what?

what is that?
that looks like the wheel of something.
I don't think it does.
a wheel.
do you have a building finished?
put it up here when it's finished.
put it back there.
what about that building there with the writing on it?

it looks nice.
I can't see it.
cafe.
a place where you sit and drink coffee.
a garage on one side and a cafe on the other?

forty two meeting and the Williams street?
what does that mean?
thirty two.
thirty two Williams Street and Greenwich Park.
do what again?
thirty two Williams Street and Greenwich Park.
what's the number on Greenwich Park?
forty?
ninety?
where does eleven and one half come in?
these are made of plastic and they might crack.
then they wouldn't be nice to play with anymore.
no, she wouldn't give it to you if they were cracked.
she'd have to throw it away.
you couldn't play with it.
but Robin and David might not want broken toys.
a what?

a what?
choochoo model?
some trim?
shrimp?
what is shrimp?
stop throwing that.
oh, did some clay fall down there too?
no no.
if you've finished why don't you put them back in the box?
are you losing weight so that you're losing your pants?
well, you've been wearing them, haven't you?
these are bombs?
what happens when you drop a bomb?
oh.
why don't you start picking them up and putting them in the box?
yours.
that's right.

I don't see your Daddy.
I think I'll sit down.

I don't know how.
I didn't play it.

she needs pens for writing, you know.
do you want a piece of paper?
you do?
it will.
why don't you write your name?
oh, I can write some other time.

I'll use my fork.
put your leg down honey.
yeah I'll get you some.
oh the orange ones too?
hello cuddly poo.
no just orange and white there you go.
crack a window get a little fresh air.
not so much cold air.
oh I'm right against the window.
it's not cold.
did you dad!
I'll get it.
dad did you have that emergency meeting at the library?
yeah we did!
what'd they say?
this is!
wait a minute I'll tell ya.
well I don't know if you know the story of what's going on in the last day or two.
well I heard what you told mom last night.
Govenor Dukakis is slashing the state budget.
I saw it on the news report.
well according to what the head honcho at the library said.
the Govenor cut the state's aid to the cities and towns.
the state gives money to the cities and towns because by two hundred and ten billion dollars.
and Worcester's share of that is about eleven million dollars.
so the city manager called in all the department heads like the head chief head of the library and all that stuff and said we're going to have to make some cuts.
he wanted them by Monday noon time three days from now to submit a new budget and to tell him what services they provided and how much those estimated services cost.
and the cuts that are going to be made will probably be personnel cuts because they don't feel that they can cut that much more in way of equipment and stuff like that.
but everybody would feel the cuts.
lower no one place would be singled out library police and fire department probably won't be exempt.
it's not clear whether everybody would feel the cuts equally.
so the particular place that I'm funded under is funded directly by the state but it goes through the city.
we've gotten our funding but it may not that may not protect my job.
and because the city.
decides who gets money for what where.
so.
picture is looking grimmer.
you know I could come back from vacation and find a computer letter in my paycheck.
because they're going to try to do this in the next few weeks.
because the sooner they can do it the more over the year they can spread it out over if they wait six months then they have to make a big cut last.
that's for me right?
yep.
what does Chi want you want steak or chicken Chi.
so!
he asked if anybody had any questions and everybody just sat there.
honey use your fork next time.
stunned to absorb the news.
no you have to have a little meat.
you have to have one now what would you.
what would you do if they cut your job?
collect unemployment unless I found another one.
hopefully I'd find another one hopefully I'll find another one before they cut it.
okay you can have both.
begin to search more seriously.
oh cucumbers are good.
so give you notice before they cut the jobs couple of weeks?
yeah probably something like two months.
although if they want to make these cuts as soon as possible I don't know.
to what extent they think.
they're going to try to make another possible because.
they maybe just.
or they can just.
give you job I mean it's not unheard of.
see you later.
you get paid on Wednesday and you take the last.
what?
what happened was the city doesn't have as much money.
oh I am.
the city doesn't have as much money and so they have to look to see how they can save money.
one of the ways they may try to save money is by taking people's jobs away.
which means that that person wouldn't have a job.
I haven't worked there very long and so my job might be one of the ones that taken away.
have to find a new job.
I don't know yet that I do but I may have to so I've been starting to look in the paper for other jobs.
that would be nice.
I want a job that's interesting to do and that pays me as much as I make now or more.
you okay?
be president.
of what?
of the United States.
I wouldn't want that job.
hundred thousand dollars a year.
that's not very that's not very much.
famous.
more than you're making now.
for all well that's true.
still not very much for all the headaches you have to put up with.
I mean there're company presidents who make four times that amount and do half as much work.
you could be a C_E_O of A_T_T.
what's that?
why?
because what?
did something happen at school today?
what happened?
oh how come he was crying so much?
maybe Jeffery was having a bad day.
would you not tear your napkin up like that?
oh!
how did he break the bike?
and he broke it?
so they didn't want him to go on a bike this time because he broke one last time.
so how come you don't want to go to your school anymore because of that?

I said okay.
oh yeah no no I didn't even tell her I didn't talk to her all day today.
well the way she said that I assumed that she knew that you were tired.
oh.
so.
uhuh.
I knew you knew your alphabet.
look at this you know what this is?
this is.
a shrimp.
yeah?
that's a shrimp.
that's not a seahorse.
it looks like a seahorse though it's curled around.
those are cute.
you little meatball.
yeah there are seahorses Sabato.
yes there is.
where is this conversation coming from?
what are we talking about the sea for?
from the food we're eating.
boy he has got a one track mind tonight huh?
I haven't seen a seahorse Sabato since I was a little girl.
they used to sell them in what store was that?
Woolworth's or Kresge's or something or Sparks?
what sweetheart what honey?
little tiny seahorses.
they were about the size of a half a dollar.
when Daddy was a little boy we used to go buy them.
little goldfish little seahorses little turtles.
they still sell the goldfish and the turtles but I I haven't seen a little seahorse in well Jesus since I was a little boy and that was a long time ago!
and don't ask me how long. they had a little tail that curls up.
that's right.
do you know what a seahorse eats?
what does a seahorse eat?
a seahorse eats plankton and microbacteria that float around in the ocean.
now you need a special lens or a special pair of glasses to see this microbacteria but it's food for the seahorses.
and the plankton.
and plankton and and microbacteria are just about the same.
and that's where they get all of their nourishment from.
now a shark is a bigger animal a bigger fish I should say and that eats a shark will eat other fish.
but not all fish.
listen listen to Daddy.
not all fish eat other fish.
there are some fish that don't eat other fish.
do you understand me?
some fish just eat plankton and like that microbacteria that I'm telling you about.
see.
that's right.
they they peck they nibble on plants and stuff like that.
and they that's right!
well, they're all fish.
a fish has to stay in the water.
now you know what a dolphin is don't you?
a dolphin doesn't have to stay in the water all of the time.
a dolphin can come up a dolphin is a mammal.
and a mammal they live in the ocean but they can breath our air.
a whale big big whale?
see the big whales?
like in Pinnochio the big whale?
that's a mammal.
it's not a fish.
it lives in the ocean like a fish but.
it's a mammal and.
it can breath our air.
a fish can't breath our air.
they have to breath the air that they make in the water.
you understand now?
alright.
this summer we're going to be going to the.
Debbi!
Debbi!
yeah?
I'm trying to put a tape on.
the aquarium we're going to go to the aquarium.
remember Daddy took you to the aquarium and the.
dolphin show?
well we're going to go again this year because you're a little bigger and you understand more and you'll they'll have seahorses there and you'll be able to see one.
how's that?
a boy is never alive if he's made out of wood.
you understand me?
alright.
Pinnochio is just a movie.
movies are make believe.
they're fictional.
they do make movies that are based on you know true life events but for the most part the things that you see on television are fictional.
in other words it's make believe.
okay?
Debbi I'd love a cup of coffee.
want some milk?
mhm.

no if someone hits him he wants to punch.

yeah you don't stand there and let somebody beat on you neither but naturally you defend yourself only if you have to.

but you don't go and hit somebody for nothing.

you may while just while I cut up the meat.
pull it out.
did he only sing this in the encore last night?
I'm sorry?
did he only sing this in the encore?
I don't know.
I'm just wondering where it is in the concert.
I'd have a tape.
for the audio tape.
I think the tops of this is six.
stand by.
and the tension just might be out.
this.
so I have to put the rest of it on the you have to start on the second side of the tape too.
lose more of of Philip Flack than anything else.
right.
the second side is the side that I had the encores on the encore on.
so I have to get that to be able to use my little cassette.
I'll do that right now.
okay.
Suzanne's sister did the New York bit?
and biscuits.
thanks.
sorry Harve.
that's okay.
do you want some Quick?
yeah.
do you want strawberry or chocolate?
so how's the chicken look?
yeah.
and you're using your new placemat.
yeah I thought he might want to try his new placemat.
there.
okay.
pardon?
so you'd like something over it.
Daddy's going to put it in your dinosaur.
no.
well I figured since you have your dinosaur placement might as well have your dinosaur cup.
so I'll wash this for another time.
I don't know.
yeah.
okay.
I think it's .
these little points.
oh they're supposed to be like grass and plants and things like that in the the landscape all around the dinosaurs.
but right here they look sharp don't they?
there you go.
warm.
what?
the chicken is should be pretty cool.
I'll cut that one and the next one you have I won't cut you can just eat it because it will be cooled off.
I knew Bro wouldn't make it home I hope he made it to the library
oh I wouldn't .
on time to get to work done because it's so early he's first.
his twenty dollars that he got for his birthday yesterday.
is burning in his pocket already.
yeah.
it's been.
that's why he didn't need money to come home from the library yesterday he said I'll have enough to.
yeah.
I'm afraid the chicken is not as well cooked as as usual.
well it's it's probably better cooked than the biscuits though.
I don't know.
well they'll both be nice and tender on the inside.
well I told Nathaniel that going out to barbecue saves more of a symbolic cash than after it was started barbecuing season.
just to celebrate the first day of spring.
how's the chicken Munchkin?
yeah.
it takes awhile.
because you just can't turn the coals on.
like you do an oven.
but when you cook it in the oven it doesn't taste this good.
excuse me I'm going to check the
here a napkin.
yeah.
mhm.
it all fit on the tape?
you got lucky.
yes.
do you have to use the bathroom, Honey?
okay.
oh.
they wriggle in their seats in Nathaniel land?
does it have rickety chairs?
why don't we turn the sound and it off.
okay thank you.
you're welcome.
oh you spilled a little bit?
okay well it's just a little.
you you got the napkin there fast.
the biscuits the biscuits aren't burned.
they're just about the way they they're supposed to be.
oh really?
yeah.
I guess the reason I was going to take them out before is because I I like them better.
under done?
not under done but done just right.
well it's just that light golden brown across the top.
that's not light golden brown.
it's medium golden brown.
but it's not burnt.
well
the other way the mushy part is supposed to be flaky.
yeah that's true.
I liked it.
true when mushy then I can't separate these little layers.
mhm.
what?
those calendars?
what this?
these barbecued calendars?
you want to eat the calendar?
when did you eat a calendar?
in what in what month would you start eating?
Nathaniel are you sure you don't have to go to the bathroom?
if you have to go to the bathroom come back and have food to eat after that.
alright.
go peepee.
that's how they sit Nathaniel down.
just to avoid confrontation.
oh the chicken's .
it is overdone but it's still it's barbecued.
yeah.
and it would be very unhealthy to have that like that all the time.
what the hell it's the first day of spring.
usually the first barbecue of the year the chicken isn't cooked right it takes a couple times in the warm weather.
in the warm weather you can still cook it and just stay out there with the barbecue.
yeah.
in the cold weather you say let's cook this sucker fast.
the sky is all overcast and today is the night that I was telling Melanie about the sky.
it's not overcast.
no?
no.
oh.
because when I looked out the window up front the sky was all gray.
we just watched the sun set.
yeah?
maybe we can go out tonight and see if we can notice where Mars and Venus and the Pleiades moon are.
there's no school today.
there's no one there to answer the phone.
it's Sunday.
they're all home eating.
even the teachers.
they're not going to go to school when they don't have to.
they have families too you know that.
you know Gail has a son and Karen has a son.
blow your nose please.
blow.
that's what I heard it alright.
well I think Karen is probably home with Christopher right now.
well shouldn't shouldn't he have his Mummy home with him on one day a week?
or two?
aren't you sad when your Mummy goes to work?
aren't you sad when your Mummy goes to work?
oh!
yeah.
I'll wait until after dinner then.
I I wanted to talk too much instead of eating.
okay eat up.
no toys at our table.
no toys at our table.
Dylan's in his last minute thing again.
he said he couldn't use the emotional side because he his part of the was very specific.
what.
it was on the economics of it.
Brendan you really should have done this before.
don't put that near your ear.
that's very sharp.
oh yuck.
I don't want
Nathaniel no.
don't swing your head around while you're eating.
are you drinking your Quick?
I mean between bites.
no swinging the head.
Daddy.
and so what did you think of the presents that Mac and Melanie gave you.
well we didn't see them at Christmas time.
because every time they were going to come down here they had snow and every time we were going to go up there the weather was bad so we had to wait until yesterday to see them and so we gave we gave Michael his birthday present because we gave them their Christmas present before Christmas.
yeah.
we well.
we gave her her birthday present Honey in August when she had her birthday.
and we gave her her Christmas present before Christmas and what they gave you was your Christmas present yesterday.
but Michael's birthday was in January.
yeah.
and we never saw him in January so that's why he got his present yesterday.
Melanie remembers that we gave her present before.
because your birthday is coming up next month.
last year they did.
mhm.
you know your your video tapes with cartoons on them?
which cartoons were they?
I don't know Bugs Bunny and things like that.
mhm.
those were from Michael and Melanie and they give you the sweatshirt that a sweatshirt that you wore yesterday and they've given you other presents too.
but those are the ones I remember.
yes yes.
that's right they gave you that the tape.
mhm.
the pin cushion man who pops the balloons?
what about him?
yeah.
no it's not.
you mean tell him not to pop the balloons?
okay.
you can tell him too you know.
yeah.
except it's a cartoon Than.
I I don't think he'll stop popping balloons because on the video he's always on the video.
popping balloons!
and and don't the balloons win in the end?
don't the balloons win in the end?
don't they find their way to get rid of the pin cushion man?
do they?
I forget.
maybe we'll have to watch the cartoon again soon to see how.
yeah.
no he can't pop their balloons any more like that.
oh.
good memory Nathaniel I didn't remember that part.
yeah.
do you want another piece of.
want another piece of chicken?
it has a lot of bone.
mhm.
let us see if I I know.
here here you go.
sorry.
oh that's alright.
I like to wrap the biscuits and have chicken and biscuits.
not me.
I want to eat dinner.
I think we should eat instead of playing television don't you think?
can you turn your television off for a couple of minutes?
oh good.
can you put it away?
alright.
it's about seven minutes to six.
what noise?
I think it's the fan that you must hear.
no the refrigerator just kicked on.
oh.
never mind.
well tough.
oh don't say that because if the refrigerator stops everything that's in the freezer will thaw and it will not be any good and everything that's in the refrigerator will get warm and it willn't be cold anymore.
we have to keep everything cold in the refrigerator.
that's why we have a refrigerator.
and it makes that noise because it's working right.
and it's a quiet noise.
Dylan is probably at the library until they're closed.
you think so?
yeah.
when he left here it was after two.
yeah.
and he's going to Earling's house today.
yeah.
and you know he probably didn't get to the library before three thirty.
probably not.
the library closes at
five thirty.
five five thirty.
five or five thirty.
I'm sorry I didn't get it.
he was saying if the library wasn't open that's alright.
other kids will be done with the books they took out of the library and and I can look at them and mine.
so social studies isn't the first thing they had in mind.

I'd like you to sit in the chair please Chi.

so what was it that you saw at the park?
a what?
no what else?
what kind of animal did you see there that you mentioned to me?
what else?
Chi you don't remember what you said you saw at the park?
what?
you don't remember the word?
an iguana.
yeah!
did its owner let let you pat him?
was he walking around all by himself?
yeah?
well I pretty much gave you a lot there kiddo.

okay.
there's butter on your potatoes
butter on your corn
yeah?
yeah well it's lamb chop.
yes.
yes!
isn't it delicious even if it's not on the cob?
that's because it's corn Chie.
corn grows!
in a great big tall stalks.
like we see at Allendale farm?
great big tall stalks.
and then this is the Chie of year it grows all summer long and this Chie of year you get to pick it.
well we're going to have a ride in the country this weekend.
I bet we'll see some corn fields.
and I'll show you.
they're real nice.
they're great big tall stalks that grow way up high.
the sports.
what are they playing?
would you like to be moved up to the table.
little bit?
yeah!
is that a little better?
you're welcome honey.
yeah?
please don't spill your milk.
it's right under your hand there.
well I think that you could possibly put it somewhere else.
see the helicopter?
that would be terrible if it was a missile.
what could happen if it was a missile?
oh well that's a scary thought.
I'm sure happy it was just a helicopter.
I'm buttering my corn.
I like mine on the cob because I have my teeth!
you'd like to try to bite well it's still pretty hot how about when it cools down a little?
okay in the meanchie you can eat yours.
you can right about.
how is it?
how is it?
how is it?
just pretty good isn't it great or maybe even delicious?
well thank you honey.
you're a good son.
well I think Nelson likes lamb chops too but the kitty has his own food.
what darling?
well that's your jaw going up and down but no thank you I I'd rather not put my finger in your ear.
I'd like to eat my dinner I know you're chewing very good come on!
I want you to chew please.
no not particularly I'd like you to get in the chair though.
that's your jaw moving inside your ear.
he's on the other side of the screen that's a pretty big bee though huh?
I think we'd probably get him first but we're not bothering him so I think we're just going to him.
would you eat some dinner please?
well I think that bees kind of like honey.
what?
over your plate please.
yeah I told you it was hot.
I wasn't kidding huh?
it's good though.
try the end the end is is a little cooler.
yeah the end right here.
how about I save you some and in the meanchie you eat some of yours too.
well it's not all gone it just melted onto your corn honey and now your corn's all buttery.
it exploded where?
disappeared?
no honey.
kitty's not supposed to bother us at the supper table.
nobody locked it?
must have locked it.
hey so did you have breakfast with papa today?
what did you have?
yeah?
yeah?
sounds like a good size breakfast to me.
papa cooks breakfast real good huh?
could can do what?
he's he's on the ledge so he's okay.
oh yeah I remember that.
I don't think so.
daddy just did that that one Chie because he was being funny.
I know but I think it might get messy honey no spraying water in my bedroom window please.
know what I use that for?
that's for when you cook the lamb chops on the barbecue somechies the fire gets real strong and burns them so I spray the fire with that and it's gone.
and they don't get too burnt.
yeah that's right.
fire go right out.
what?
yeah.
you having trouble getting the corn on your spoon?
you're doing pretty good at.
yeah that's okay.
you know what else might be easier?
if you just do it sideways and make it crash into your mashed potatoes and you won't chase them all over.
to what?
fork and a spoon okay?
how do you like eating on the back porch?
we haven't done this in a while huh?
know what made me remember?
you mentioned it last night that you'd like to eat on the back porch.
and that gave me an idea!
think maybe you need to drink your milk honey.
what tape were you watching in the living room before dinner?
mhm.
three things are yeah?
I didn't know that.
oh really?
have you watched your new Mighty Mouse tape yet?
was it any good?

I'm almost all done!
yep.
it's just right now.
you can hold it.
try to bite up with your bottom teeth.
any better?
what?
what the end things?

not with butter.
you just put it in the pan all by yourself cover it up and then cook it for about eight minutes.
good.
what about can you get it?

comes out pretty yummy too.
good job.
good job honey.

okay that one's yours.
alright.
I promise.
you're going to stay in bed the whole night?
that's the first thing you're going to do?
uhhuh.
yeah?
late in the morning does that mean you're not going to wave goodbye to me out the window?
that's pretty early!
that's seven thirty.
oh okay.
so you know what you could do?
you could get up and wave to me out the window and then go back to bed.
why?
I see.
mhm.
I would bet.
you know why?
remember what their house is made out of their fort?
do you remember what it was?
uhoh it was a firehouse yeah that's right.
not a new one an old one remember when they remember they went to see it it was a mess?
remember?
that was in the movie.
yeah.
and it was real messy wasn't it?

honey they don't hurt your skin honestly.
you don't need mittens they don't hurt your skin they're just little sparklers.
please come on up in your chair.
I know you're only that many but you know what?
they don't hurt you yes you can feel the sparks but no they don't hurt.
you just can feel them but they don't hurt.
and you know what else?
can I just ask you something you know honey I wouldn't give you anything that would hurt you.
what?
know what?
I don't know but you know what?
you look so sleepy.

I don't like doodoo head.
I don't like name calling.
I think it's the doggie next door.
he's pulling on his chain.
yes they do.
well somechies they do.
but we're so lucky we have a cat and we don't need a dog.
what?
very good.

that's a sad quiet cat.
yeah?
I want to hear a happy cat.
whoa that's a good one.
yeah it is it's kind of
I think you need a new basketball hoop yes.
Ghostbuster cat?
I've never seen a Ghostbusters basketball hoop.
I've seen Larry Bird ones because Larry Bird plays for what team?

yeah he plays basketball but do you remember for who the name of the team?
Boston Celtics.
Boston Red Sox play what?
that's right.
yeah yep.
he hits lots of home runs somechies.
a big towel for where?
well you know what we'll do we'll get a new one of those but we won't let it be outside and then it won't get wrecked so fast and then we'll make it taller because we can make that taller.
nope leave it alone please honey and finish your dinner.
uhoh what?

oh that's the.
okay put it on the floor.
how's that.
oh you okay?

are you sure?
well some Chie if you want maybe you can a little friend over and you can camp out on the back porch.
you okay?
no you I think you're choking on your food a little bit I think you have little.
from winter Chie?
what?
well!
I'm sure you would be excited but momma does not like to camp in the woods.\
your daddy likes to camp in the woods.
he does!
he's a a great outdoors man he has lots of camping equipment.
I think you ought to get on him to bring you camping the woods.
I figure he would he would love that.
what?
mhm?
yeah?
yes we could have a cookout.
well I rather like our picnics on the back porch.
what?
mhm.
yeah.
there aren't a real lot of wild animals here.

when you're asleep somechies your dreams are very real.
but it's just your imagination working while the rest of you sleeps.

it did what was your dream about?
the monster grabbed you on your head but that didn't come true no monster really grabbed you on your neck.
it did?
when?
yeah?
come on I'd just like you to finish it.
it did?
no honey it didn't come true.
you know I would never let any monsters get you.
besides what did I tell you about monsters?
they're only make believe and they only live in movies because somebody with a wonderful imagination makes up monsters.
and all other sort of special effects to make the really scary monsters you know like how you watch Michael Jackson?
and they show him putting his makeup on for Thriller?
that's just because somebody had a great imagination.
but no there's no such things as monsters.
there's some scary creatures like lions very fierce and scary.
but.
we're safe from them.
what?
excuse me?
Nelson please get down.
Chi our house isn't going to come alive.
well but that's just make believe sweetheart.
nope no toys honey please put your toy down until after we're all done.
yeah.
you you were starting to tell me something and I was interested.
no that that's just plastic mold honey just like your Playdough okay?
if somebody found a dinosaur they wouldn't shoot it.
no we would never shoot it.
no that was made by good people that's just a mold like the molds with your Playdough?
Chi!
honey you had two bites on your plate.
I'd like you to finish them.
alright but you can just have a little corn and a little mashed potato.

must be because it's cooked on the grill you love that grill.
what darling?
tomorrow night you're going to go to your daddy's house.
excuse me?
I'm not cooking good?
I thought you loved that stuff.
well honey he jumped up on the dinner table he's just being a bad kitty tonight I gave him a whole bunch of treats and he's not letting us eat our dinner.
I know but I guess he has.
I know he wants to eat everything that's why he got pushed on the floor.
and if he wants to see us I guess he'll just have to sit on the floor and look up.
that's nice of you to be so concerned about him.
you're a wonderful son.
you're the best little guy in the whole wide world.
yeah you all done?
going to have any more potatoes?

that's that supper goes right to those muscles.
well muscles are more important they help me in lifting things and keeping healthy.

well we'll just have to see.
I hope they are!
alright.
not too far.
they're alright.
is that red light on?
yeah.
it's voice activated.
oh it is?
yes.
how's your supper?
oh did you get your drink?
okay.
it is.
because look.
yeah I know but I'm just trying to see if the tape is going around.
it is.
I already tried.
yeah.
right now so don't drink a lot okay?
save some and don't eat all the cantaloupe.
eat some of your eat some of your other stuff okay?
okay?
so cut it out.
you might as well squish that down a little bit.
well
don't .
don't squish it so hard that it comes out!
yeah.
good supper huh?
hey move up close!
what's the matter?
your stomach hurts?
well eat slowly.
chew up your food really good okay?
well if it hurts that much just eat your cantaloupe.
don't eat you know too much.
don't make it hurt more okay?
well don't eat fast!
he's not.
he's going to eat slow.
want some broccoli?
it's delicious!
lemon!
all the nice florets.
like little trees!
you can pretend you're a giant!
was that me?
my gosh.
sensitive isn't it?
yeah.
well we were just checking out the little red light on it.
watch your juice.
like when you talk it goes on.
see?
so.
see?
now if you say something watch.
it gets brighter as you talk.
that was my ice cube.
that little squeal was my ice cube.
tell Daddy what you did today what we did today.
sure you do.
well we didn't do too much.
what did we do?
we played some games.
what games did we play?
mhm.
didn't we play Fish?
who won?
who won let's see.
first time we played Chutes and Ladders
who won?
I think so.
and then we we we played Memory Game.
who won that?
mhm.
you won?
yeah he's really good at the Memory game.
mhm.
mhm. mhm.
and we watched Lady and the Tramp, huh?
well.
see every time you talk that little red light comes on.
when it's not playing music.
it's recording what we're talking about.
I think that was all we played.
mhm. oh yeah.
did we play Fish twice?
I think we just played one time.
here have some more sandwich.
yeah?
want some.
that's nice.
want to try some chicken?
I love you too.
it's really good.
oh yeah.
well here have some more of your.
right!
you ate a whole bunch of it that time didn't you?
have some more.
sandwich then Chi.
no.
here.
have some more food you you might.
I don't think that's what gave you the tummyache because that was kind of a long time ago and you just got your tummyache now.
that was a couple of weeks ago that you ate that chicken.
it doesn't take a few weeks to get a tummyache.
have some more.
you could have a tummyache because you're hungry.
because you haven't been eating.
here don't you want some more of that?
well I'm almost done so.
don't eat too fast.
just have some more of that anyway.
you better start eating then.
even though he seemed to feel better today I'm glad I kept him out of day care.
mhm.
he still seemed to be you know kind of huh?
right!
or your fever.
well that's what when you feel when your skin feels real hot.
that's a fever.
it's really hard to understand you when you talk with food in your mouth though okay?
well yeah it's pretty warm in here.
it's not that bad.
are you hot?
oh Chi not the fan!
it'll cool it'll cool our meal off too quickly.
come on Chi you're making a mess.
will you please sit down?
thank you.
it's too cold to have that on anyway.
good sandwich though huh?
what are you doing?
you're all done?
don't you want any cantaloupe?
well if it hurts your tummy to eat then don't eat but you may not have anything else.
this will make your tummy feel better probably Chi.
now I'm not going to get any.
because you haven't eaten and so that's why your tummy's probably doesn't feel very good because you don't have any food.
that wouldn't be bad news.
oh!
uhoh.
one sick pony.
you want to lie down on the couch for a little while?
oh no!
not now.
Chi once a day you can watch it alright?
not ten times a day.
no you don't !
it's nice to just have quiet around here for once.
well while I'm eating I want quiet.
yes.
don't you even want your delicious cantaloupe?
nice juicy cantaloupe?
why don't you drink your juice at least?
I'm afraid you're becoming dehydrated.
you're going to get too skinny.
your little muscles will go away if you don't eat though!
they'll shrink!
mhm.
oh gee!
that I could live without.
that's not even water is it?
well
I don't have work tomorrow and you don't have day care so we'll just hang out again in the house and then hopefully you'll be all better for Friday.
because Friday I have to go to work.
on Friday?
yeah.
and you have day care and it's toy day on Friday and you can bring a toy.
well toy day's not until the day after tomorrow Chi.
I guess it requires a lot of thought.
what?
picking out a toy.
oh.
you could bring your Superman cape again.
I don't know bring it in.
I can't see.
yeah!
yeah.
if you didn't scare anybody with it but sure.
where did we get that anyway?
do you remember?
on the Cape was it?
down in Provincetown I think?
I think.
oh!
it was in Provincetown?
mhm.
oh yeah!
looks like it has got a big smile doesn't it?
maybe hey!
maybe it'll eat the rest of your cantaloupe.
oh okay.
maybe that wasn't such a good idea was it?
can I have this thing?
had a hankering for egg salad did you?
it looks so good all the egg salad's popping out of the sandwiches.
well they'll shrink if you keep this up.
you didn't eat hardly anything yesterday and you shertainly certainly didn't eat hardly anything today.
had about three bites of breakfast.
had about two bites of lunch.
and two bites of supper.
well there's two more bites.
whoa!
but I guess if you're not throwing up or anything.
I guess that's okay.
what?
Jesse has a robot hand?
Jesse at school?
right.
that's what I figured.
a robot hand?
is that what you said?

because I don't think it's funny and I don't think it's the correct thing to do at the dinner table or at your mother.
I don't know.
it just bothers me.
pretending to shoot somebody isn't really a nice thing.
well it looks like it.
a telescope?

I think so because I don't see it.
do you see it?
I don't see it.
how do you catch a ball?
with your mouth?
and how does the tiger catch a ball?
with his mouth.
that's a walrus.
this boy is giving the walrus some water.

well, the llama is pretty big compared to the boy, isn't he?
nothing.
the llama's very gentle.
but he's a lot bigger than this boy.
is the goat bigger or littler than the boy?
let me see this picture.
I missed this picture.
who are they feeding here?
oh, that's sweet.

did you see llamas at the zoo?
these are pretty big turtles, aren't they?
where's the boy?
wow, he must be a pretty big turtle
to be able to ride on.
most turtles are little, aren't they?
um, I think more turtles are little.
at Cape Cod.
we saw a turtle, remember?
in a fish tank?
it was a little tiny turtle.
you couldn't ride on it, could you?
this is a great big tortoise.
what are they doing?
what do you think they're feeding him?
who's pushing him?
do you think the elephant is heavy or light?
is it easy to push an elephant?
must be pretty hard, don't you think?
they're pretty heavy.
he's cuddling him.
he's getting real close.
he's playing.
what's this?
it's all curled around, isn't it?
look at the feet of the elephant.
must be pretty heavy.
I wouldn't like to be stepped on by an elephant, would you?
what would it do to your foot?
oh, I like elephants but I wouldn't put my foot under an elephant.
you wouldn't either, would you?
what's he doing here?
that man is asking for something to drink for the elephant.
and look, what's the boy doing?
oh, do you think elephants drink milk?
I think so.
that must be milk in there.
oh, that's a pretty big bottle of milk, isn't it?
do you think the elephant will drink it all up?
what's on top of the elephant's head?
what's that growing up there?
looks like hair, doesn't it?
what are these people doing?
laughing?
whose head is coming out here?
oh, who's he talking to?
and who's in this picture?
no, this animal has two humps, so what do you think it is?
and he's eating a cookie.
who do you think is giving him a cookie?
yeah, all we can see is the hand.
who do you think the hand belongs to?
do you think a little boy is outside the picture?
we can't see him, can we?
he's hiding.
who do we see in the picture?
oh, we can't see the boy.
that's pretty funny.
all we can see is a hand coming out.
and that's a cookie.

no, a fruit.
a little round fruit.
what do you think it is?
no, grapes.
he's feeding him lots of grapes.
oh, what's the monkey doing?
do you think he does?
who's tying it back up?
do you think the monkey knows how to tie it too?
I think the monkey probably just unties the shoe, don't you think?
I don't think a monkey knows how to tie up a shoe.
I think he just knows how to untie it.
and he keeps untying the shoe and the girl ties up the shoe.
and he unties the shoe and the girl ties up the shoe.
oh.
that's not a helicopter.
what is that?
oh, what's the chimpanzee goING To do?

looks like a little white lamb.
oh, it's a woolly dog then.
all kinds of people in this class room aren't there?
I don't think that's where this goes.
I don't know where, but that doesn't look like the right place.
maybe it fits back like this.

no.
you look through this window.

that's very good.
where did you sing that?
where did you learn this song?
what letter is this?
what is this?
well, you're right.
hey, Nina, we haven't finished snacks yet.
you said you were going to give them snacks.
they're all hungry.
what are you goING To give them?
what are you goING To do now?
who gets the snacks out at your school usually?
what does Mel give you for snacks?
he doesn't give you letters.
what does he give you to eat?
oh, I don't believe that's what he gives you.
what does he give you?
does he give you milk?
no.
no.
do you know, do you know what I bet he gives you for for snacks?
I bet he gives you some pieces of cheese.

I'm going to take them for a ride.
and you can't take them.
you can't take them.

that's an xl.
where are you putting all the letters?
on the floor?
where?
oh, this roof is made out of a magnet.
oh, what is this boy doing?
he's doing the same thing you are, isn't he?
and what's she doing?
try and see.
I don't think so.
I don't think it's a magnet on this side.
does it stick?
nope, not on that side.
there's only one side of the roof that's a magnet.
but I wanT To put these letters on.
well, then you'll have to take those letters off.
does Mel spell words at school for you sometime?
can you find the beginning of your name?
what is this letter?
do you know this letter?
I don't think you know how to spell your name yet, do you?
that's right.
it begins with an nl.
but we can't spell it because we only have one nl.
no, that's an ml.
there's an nl in Nonna's hand.
hey, Nina, these children are getting hungry over here.
they're saying.
Mel, Josh, where are our snacks?
and you didn't bring them any snacks.
can you bring them some snacks?
but they're going to get impatient if they sit here forever.
maybe we better take them out for the swings.
where are you putting him?
oh, that's not a way to go on a swing, is it?
now who's going to go with him?
who's that?
oh.
and who's she going on the seesaw with?
Nina, tell Nonna about Spencer.

are these doors?
no, I think they're windows.
the what?
the chalk is in a box somewhere.

and let the chalk board down.
now you can chalk on the chalk board.
but you better erase that first.
do you see the eraser anywhere?
there it is.
that says fisher price.
that's the name of the kind of toy that you're playing with.
that erases very well.
it's a real eraser.

um?
what is inside that package?
I can't see.

we can use the box from your sneakers to keep the letters in.
ok?
no, just this part of the roof gets up.

people go in the schoolhouse instead, don't they?
what are you doing with the people?

the elephants are wearing some pretty decorations.
now shall we build a swing?
there.
what's that clown holding?
oh.

what are you goING To take off?
ok, now you can build whatever you want.
this is really a nice thing.
ok, what do you wanT To build now?
that's a horse.
ok, now what would you like to build?
here are some legs.

yeah, he's missing his head.
that's the most important part, isn't it?

ok, shall we build a bicycle for him?
there you go.

we saw seals at the zoo once.
remember?
the San Francisco Zoo?
they're in San Francisco.
ok.
what did the seals do at the zoo when we went.
remember?
no, they were going on the slide.
weren't they
or those were penguins.
those were the penguins.
the seals were swimming in the water, I think.
I think it was penguins.
not seals.
I think the seals are probably too big to slide on slides.
penguins are smaller.
it's a trick that they learned.
for the fun of it.
remember?
and then they went swimming around afterwards.
and the man fed them some fish?
you liked the zoo when I took you there.
the ducks were
what did the ducks
where were the goats?
yeah, they were walking around, weren't they?
and what did you do with the goats?
you had some food in your hand, didn't you?
he did?
what did it feel like?
kind of wet?
was it kind of wet?
the the lick of the billy goat was kind of wet, I think.
does what hurt?
no, it doesn't hurt.
what is this story about?
and where is he going?
where's that boy going, do you think?
oh, where do you think he's feeding the elephant?
yeah, the elephant fell down.
what's the boy doing here?
I don't know why he fell down.
I think he tripped.
he's just a baby.
he tripped over.
so he fell down.
because that's what happened to him.
well, sometimes babies don't know how to walk very well.
even Kirsten.
does she walk?
why doesn't she walk?
what does Kirsten do?
yeah well, that's
this is a baby elephant.
and he probably just learned how to walk.
and that's why he fell down.
what's happening in this picture?
we'll have to go to the San Francisco Zoo then and see all the animals.
ummhm.
what are they doing?
what's this penguin doing?
they are?
what are they doing?
I don't know.
what do you think that seal is doing?
he's trying to lick the boy.
there, he's talking to him.
he's got a big mouth, doesn't he?
oh, he's got an awfully wet tongue.
why does he?
um?
because it's big.
what did he do here?
yeah, that seal's kissing the boy.
they're in the zoo.
in the cage.
he wants to play with the seal.
what is he playing with the seal?
no, they're on the ground there.

what are they doing here?
um?
they're playing ball there, aren't they?
what's happening there?
it's a book all about the zoo.
we got it for you one day when I saw it.
I thought you would like it because I knew you liked the zoo, so
what's happening there?
wow, that must be difficult to do.
oh, only grownups can do that.
people who are lion trainers can do that.
actually that's a lion.
that's pretty dangerous to pick up a lion.
because they could bite you.
because they could bite you.
because he's a lion trainer.
looks like a nice lion though, doesn't he?
he's eating something.
can you tell what it is?
no, I think it's a bone.
what's this little girl saying to him, do you think?
what do you think she's saying?
what would you say if you met a lion?
is that what you would say to the lion?
no.
you wouldn't go inside the cage.
you would stay outside the cage.
I don't know.
that's a strange place for her to be.
that must be a very tame lion.
and the man must have said it was ok to go inside.
she's playing with him.
what kind of a game do you think she wants to play with him?
no, that's the ball.
it's hanging down in front.
what did she attach the ball to?
I see.
so you see what she's doing?
she's dangling the string in front of him.
why do you think?
ummhm.
no, that's not you.
that's another girl.
does that look like you?
I don't know what her name is.
she's a bigger girl then you are.

what's he doing here?
he's looking at a story all about the walrus.
oh, I think the little boy is going for a walk somewhere.
do you go for walks?
where do you like to go for walks?
where?
where else?
do we go for walks in the woods sometime?
yeah and we went to foothill park, remember?
we went on a hike up a hill?
because I like to be outside.
don't you like to be outside?

come here , honey.
Nina, if you want to use water you let me get it because you got
here.
ok.
well, honey, you know what?
let me tell you.
ok, I'll tell you how you can do it.
if you take this I'm goING To bring a little pot and we can wash
because that floor is all wet already.
so here's the wet wash cloth.
and I'll make a little pot.
and we can make a bathtub for the dolly.
ok.
I'll get a little pot.
we're goING To use a little pot.
but we don't wanT To get too much water on
so here we go.
let's be careful not to spill much water on the floor.
put her in the middle.
you can use this to shampoo her with.
like I use for you.
well, where is the other one?
you had two.
where did you put the other one?
you put it away somewhere.
remember?
wait a minute.
you opened one.
in a box, I think.
over there.
look in that box.
I bet you put it in that box over there.
with the black and white spots on it.
find it?
find it?
so how are you going to wash her hair now?
the last one?
she doesn't need any more then that.
ok.
now you give her a good bath.
get her all clean.
uhhuh.
that's a syringe.
I used to use that when you were a little baby when you had ear
ummhm.
when you have an earache.
you can use that for a bottle of shampoo.
here, let's pretend to put the shampoo in here.
ok, it's all full of shampoo.
that's the shampoo bottle.
now what are you doing?
hmm?
where?
hey, you're dripping.
don't drip on your knee.
did you put some shampoo on her head?
and now what are you doing?
you scrubbing?
does she like it?
what is she saying?
would you put
no, we said that was enough.
we have three.
that's plenty.
where's the third one?
what you do with the third one?
hmm?
where'd you put it?
I opened three for you already.
be careful not to get wet on the floor.
now let's

you put it in front of her eyes?
what do you want me to do?
how?
with what?
or with the bucket?
ok, where shall I pour it?
oh, all over her head.
just like I do Nina's hair.
now what?
no, leave the wash cloth in there because you're goING To
I see.
what are you doing now?
putting the shampoo bottle in your mouth?
no, where does the shampoo bottle go?
back in the bag, I guess.
is that where you're going to store it?
hmm?
ok, she must be finished by now.
is she?
did you wash her back and everything?
a bottle in the bathtub?
you don't drink bottles in bathtubs.
you have to dry her first before you give her a bottle.
shall I get you a towel to dry her or does she still need to be
hmm?
oh, there's plenty of water.
look at all the water.
it's all over.
why do you need it full?
what are you goING To do when it's full?
wanT To little more water?
you keep keep the dolly in there and I'll bring a bucket in with
there, that's enough water now.
no, that's plenty.
she'll drown otherwise.
because there'll be too much water.
you don't fill the bathtub up over your neck, do you?
that's enough because you know what would happen?
it would spill all over the rug.
and then we'd have one big wet rug.
I usually fill the bathtub half way up.
just like that pot.
there's about as much.
I'll put some of this in here.
like this, pour it into the bowl.
here we go.
want all the water in the bowl?
ok, be careful.
oh, you're dripping the wash cloth all over the floor.
ok, put the wash cloth back in.
there's plenty in there.
that's too much.
uhoh, honey.
no, don't do that.
that's going to make too much of a mess.
put it back in the bathtub.
woopla.
there we go.
back in the bathtub.
there's plenty of water in the bowl.
Nina, listen carefully.
Nina, if you don't stop

ok.
got to be very gentle.
see, you're spilling it.
there you go.
what are you doing to her hair now?

what are you doing?
you goING To squeeze the water out of the shampoo bottle?
all over her.
where is it falling?
do what?
oh, honey, when you yell like that I willn't do anything.
you have to learn how to ask for things nicely.
doesn't that make a funny bubble?
look at the bubble.
ok, now shall I get you the great big blue towel for her?
still?
how are you goING To do that without getting water all over everything?
you got to what?

that's just a piece of paper that was wrapped around the top of the

there's nothing in there.
that was the top of the teapot.
now why don't you dry dolly and you can give her some things from

that looks pretty.
can you unzip yourself?
yeah, you have to leave your undershirt on.

so let's see.
you wanT To be hot?
let's see.
see if we can get this turtleneck on you.
uhoh, what happened?
oh, where's your face?
what happened to you?

this is such a pretty pair of pants.
can you put them on by yourself?
let's see.
do you know where the green hat is?
I haven't seen the green hat for a long time.
where do you think it finished up?
you're right.
that green hat goes with that.
but I don't know where it is.
let's see if it still fits you.
too tight?
uhoh, what happened?
it's not in there.
I think it's at Nola's .
because I brought an extra hat to Nola's .
so we're goING To stop at Nola's house today and pick up all the
this is a pretty sweater.
no, today you're goING To go with Mommy to Golden_Gate_Park.
and you know what we're goING To go on?
we're goING To go on a merrygoround.
what would you like to ride on on the merrygoround?
sit down.
put on your shoes and socks.
which animal do you think you want to ride on?
I think that there's a great big merrygoround with horses on it
what's your favorite animal to ride on?
a horsie?
remember we went to the zoo?
and there was a merrygoround at the zoo?
and it had all different sorts of animals.
it had lions and it had horses.
I don't know what their merrygoround at Golden_Gate is like.
and maybe we'll go to the tea garden?
you went to the tea garden with Mommy once.
and the aquarium is there.
what would you see at the aquarium, do you think?
I wonder if Elizabeth has been.
Elizabeth is goING To come with us.
here now.
wait a second.
oh, these are new socks.
aren't they pretty?
stand up and see if it fits.
oh, you look very pretty.
here, hold this up.
can you hold that up for me?
hold up the sweater.
I wanT To show you a beautiful doll that I have.
that Nonna sent for you.
straighten up a place for her so we can play with her.
I bet she would like some of your tea.
the tea is not for her?
here's a funny insect.
what is he doing?
wait a minute.
no, Elizabeth is reading.
let me find this other thing and we'll play with it.
and then we'll go to Elizabeth.
come here.
we're going to find something beautiful, I can only find it.
it's a beautiful new dolly.
just for us to play with for a few minutes.
let me see the cricket.
ok, look.
let's twist him.
what can we do with his feet, you think?
where do you think he wants to go?
oh, why don't you take him to the park?
there's the park over there.
show him Golden_Gate_Park.
what is he goING To see first?
where what is he goING To see at the park?
what is he goING To do?
you want him what?
you want him up?
he is?
where is he sliding?
do you think there'll be a slide at the park?
do you know who we're going to go with to San_Francisco?
we're going to go with Anne_Marie.
you met Anne_Marie the other day.
French friend.
what's the cricket doing?
why is he getting cold?
well, let's do something about it.
maybe we can cover him with something.
how about this nice soft blanket.
is it winter?
is that why he's cold?
he's got very funny eyes.
we will.
just a minute.
let me finish up in here.
I wanT To get everything done in here because Elizabeth is talking
now look.
let's find some new shoes for you.
do you know where your new shoes are?
they would look nice with this.
do you know where they are?
maybe in here?
oh, would you like to wear these shoes?
they're at Nola's , I bet.
let's put these brand new ones on.
because you know what?
the red matches the red on your sweater.
the red shoes matches the red design.
see, the red design on your pants.
what should we take along?
is that what you wanT To hold in the park?
well, we can't , we shouldn't probably take the toys into the park.
but you can take them in the car and hold them in the car.
so I have to wear white shoes.
well, we don't have any white shoes but we have red shoes.
I think these'll be ok don't you?
but you have to remind me to stop at Nola's house and get all the
I sure left a lot of clothes over there.
there we go.
no, I wanT To see you.
I think we should make him dance.
crickets like to dance.
ok, in a few minutes.
Elizabeth is busy right now.
I'm going to play with this.
but just here.
would you like to play with it too?
Nonno sent this to you.
we have to be very careful.
we have to keep this doll up there.
the baby's in her arms.
what do you think that is?
she's all dressed up and she has earrings on her ears.
to look pretty.
well, I guess she's probably going to go dancing.
do you like that red dress?
that's the prettiest dolly I've ever seen.
hmm?
those are red shoes like you have.
what color shoes do you have?
well, she has red shoes on too.
let me see.
no, those are shoes.
but you know what happened?
some of the paint has come off and so her toes are coming through.
that's what happened.
she we should keep her in this box.
but you can take her out and give her some tea if you want.
I bet she would like that.
it isn't ?
why?
uhoh, careful, that's a pin.
it's a hat pin.
or hairpin to keep her hair in place.
no, that's an earring.
this is a pin to hold her hair in place.
is it sharp?
on the other ear.
the needle is to hold her hair.
you know sometimes you put your hair up in a bun?
then you have to put something around it.
to keep it up.
otherwise it could fall down.
does she have bangs?
what does she have?
that's a pin and it matches her earrings.
look at her pretty eyes.
they open and shut.
little blue eyes.
that's a pin.
a decoration.
oh, let me see.
I think it's just stuck on.
I think the only thing with a sharp pin is her hairpin.
that's a hairpin.
and that's her hair.
it's a bun.
that's another hairpin.
there isn't one.
only there.
what is she wearing?
let's try to see.
she's wearing so many different things.
that's a real dress.
and what's on top of it?
what's this?
is that an apron, you think?
what's she wearing here?
it's a pretty gold necklace, isn't it?
what?
part of her apron.
I think she is goING To go to the store.
why don't you take her to the store?
you can pretend this is the store.
and where's the lady that would sell at the store?
could this be the lady that sells at the store?
ok.
I'll be the lady at the store.
what would you like to buy?
some oranges?
what kind of oranges?
big ones or little ones?
juicy ones or dry ones?
what are you going to use the oranges for?
who's going to eat them?
just you?
oh, does your baby like oranges?
how will she eat them?
but can she open them?
can she peel them by herself?
you peel them for her?
how come you peel them for her?
because she can't peel them by herself.
ok, how many oranges would you like?
you'd like to split one orange with your baby?
ok, let me go see if I have any oranges.
uhoh.
we're all out of oranges.
what can I give you instead?
we just sold our last orange.
I know you like them, we're going to be getting some more oranges
but before tomorrow what would you like?
would you like some other kind of fruit?
what would you like?
but we don't have any.
would you like to get something else?
some spaghetti.
ok.
what kind of spaghetti?
we have all different kinds.
long thin spaghetti.
we have short macaroni.
we have noodles.
ok, would you like the thinnest kind or would you like the flat spaghetti or would you like a really wide piece of spaghetti?
what kind do you like?
long one or
the long thin one?
ok, let me go get some of that.
I have to go upstairs to get that.
here you go.
that will cost five cents.
can you get the money?
ok, I will need some money before I can give you the spaghetti.
do you have any money in your bag?
ok.
thank you and now I have to give you some change.
how much change do I owe you?
do you know how much I owe you?
I think it must be about three cents.
here we go.
here's your change.
are you going to go to San_Francisco with your child today?
where are you going to take your child?
what are you going to do at the zoo?
really?
is your child big enough to ride on the merrygoround?
on the merrygoround.
are you goING To ride on an animal or on the seat?
you're going to ride on the seat?
I see.
the seat goes round and round and the animals go up and down.
so which are you going to go on?
I know.
