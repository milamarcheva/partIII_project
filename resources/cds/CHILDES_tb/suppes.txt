I think so because I don't see it.
do you see it?
I don't see it.
how do you catch a ball?
with your mouth?
and how does the tiger catch a ball?
with his mouth.
that's a walrus.
this boy is giving the walrus some water.

well, the llama is pretty big compared to the boy, isn't he?
nothing.
the llama's very gentle.
but he's a lot bigger than this boy.
is the goat bigger or littler than the boy?
let me see this picture.
I missed this picture.
who are they feeding here?
oh, that's sweet.

did you see llamas at the zoo?
these are pretty big turtles, aren't they?
where's the boy?
wow, he must be a pretty big turtle
to be able to ride on.
most turtles are little, aren't they?
um, I think more turtles are little.
at Cape Cod.
we saw a turtle, remember?
in a fish tank?
it was a little tiny turtle.
you couldn't ride on it, could you?
this is a great big tortoise.
what are they doing?
what do you think they're feeding him?
who's pushing him?
do you think the elephant is heavy or light?
is it easy to push an elephant?
must be pretty hard, don't you think?
they're pretty heavy.
he's cuddling him.
he's getting real close.
he's playing.
what's this?
it's all curled around, isn't it?
look at the feet of the elephant.
must be pretty heavy.
I wouldn't like to be stepped on by an elephant, would you?
what would it do to your foot?
oh, I like elephants but I wouldn't put my foot under an elephant.
you wouldn't either, would you?
what's he doing here?
that man is asking for something to drink for the elephant.
and look, what's the boy doing?
oh, do you think elephants drink milk?
I think so.
that must be milk in there.
oh, that's a pretty big bottle of milk, isn't it?
do you think the elephant will drink it all up?
what's on top of the elephant's head?
what's that growing up there?
looks like hair, doesn't it?
what are these people doing?
laughing?
whose head is coming out here?
oh, who's he talking to?
and who's in this picture?
no, this animal has two humps, so what do you think it is?
and he's eating a cookie.
who do you think is giving him a cookie?
yeah, all we can see is the hand.
who do you think the hand belongs to?
do you think a little boy is outside the picture?
we can't see him, can we?
he's hiding.
who do we see in the picture?
oh, we can't see the boy.
that's pretty funny.
all we can see is a hand coming out.
and that's a cookie.

no, a fruit.
a little round fruit.
what do you think it is?
no, grapes.
he's feeding him lots of grapes.
oh, what's the monkey doing?
do you think he does?
who's tying it back up?
do you think the monkey knows how to tie it too?
I think the monkey probably just unties the shoe, don't you think?
I don't think a monkey knows how to tie up a shoe.
I think he just knows how to untie it.
and he keeps untying the shoe and the girl ties up the shoe.
and he unties the shoe and the girl ties up the shoe.
oh.
that's not a helicopter.
what is that?
oh, what's the chimpanzee goING To do?

looks like a little white lamb.
oh, it's a woolly dog then.
all kinds of people in this class room aren't there?
I don't think that's where this goes.
I don't know where, but that doesn't look like the right place.
maybe it fits back like this.

no.
you look through this window.

that's very good.
where did you sing that?
where did you learn this song?
what letter is this?
what is this?
well, you're right.
hey, Nina, we haven't finished snacks yet.
you said you were going to give them snacks.
they're all hungry.
what are you goING To give them?
what are you goING To do now?
who gets the snacks out at your school usually?
what does Mel give you for snacks?
he doesn't give you letters.
what does he give you to eat?
oh, I don't believe that's what he gives you.
what does he give you?
does he give you milk?
no.
no.
do you know, do you know what I bet he gives you for for snacks?
I bet he gives you some pieces of cheese.

I'm going to take them for a ride.
and you can't take them.
you can't take them.

that's an xl.
where are you putting all the letters?
on the floor?
where?
oh, this roof is made out of a magnet.
oh, what is this boy doing?
he's doing the same thing you are, isn't he?
and what's she doing?
try and see.
I don't think so.
I don't think it's a magnet on this side.
does it stick?
nope, not on that side.
there's only one side of the roof that's a magnet.
but I wanT To put these letters on.
well, then you'll have to take those letters off.
does Mel spell words at school for you sometime?
can you find the beginning of your name?
what is this letter?
do you know this letter?
I don't think you know how to spell your name yet, do you?
that's right.
it begins with an nl.
but we can't spell it because we only have one nl.
no, that's an ml.
there's an nl in Nonna's hand.
hey, Nina, these children are getting hungry over here.
they're saying.
Mel, Josh, where are our snacks?
and you didn't bring them any snacks.
can you bring them some snacks?
but they're going to get impatient if they sit here forever.
maybe we better take them out for the swings.
where are you putting him?
oh, that's not a way to go on a swing, is it?
now who's going to go with him?
who's that?
oh.
and who's she going on the seesaw with?
Nina, tell Nonna about Spencer.

are these doors?
no, I think they're windows.
the what?
the chalk is in a box somewhere.

and let the chalk board down.
now you can chalk on the chalk board.
but you better erase that first.
do you see the eraser anywhere?
there it is.
that says fisher price.
that's the name of the kind of toy that you're playing with.
that erases very well.
it's a real eraser.

um?
what is inside that package?
I can't see.

we can use the box from your sneakers to keep the letters in.
ok?
no, just this part of the roof gets up.

people go in the schoolhouse instead, don't they?
what are you doing with the people?

the elephants are wearing some pretty decorations.
now shall we build a swing?
there.
what's that clown holding?
oh.

what are you goING To take off?
ok, now you can build whatever you want.
this is really a nice thing.
ok, what do you wanT To build now?
that's a horse.
ok, now what would you like to build?
here are some legs.

yeah, he's missing his head.
that's the most important part, isn't it?

ok, shall we build a bicycle for him?
there you go.

we saw seals at the zoo once.
remember?
the San Francisco Zoo?
they're in San Francisco.
ok.
what did the seals do at the zoo when we went.
remember?
no, they were going on the slide.
weren't they
or those were penguins.
those were the penguins.
the seals were swimming in the water, I think.
I think it was penguins.
not seals.
I think the seals are probably too big to slide on slides.
penguins are smaller.
it's a trick that they learned.
for the fun of it.
remember?
and then they went swimming around afterwards.
and the man fed them some fish?
you liked the zoo when I took you there.
the ducks were
what did the ducks
where were the goats?
yeah, they were walking around, weren't they?
and what did you do with the goats?
you had some food in your hand, didn't you?
he did?
what did it feel like?
kind of wet?
was it kind of wet?
the the lick of the billy goat was kind of wet, I think.
does what hurt?
no, it doesn't hurt.
what is this story about?
and where is he going?
where's that boy going, do you think?
oh, where do you think he's feeding the elephant?
yeah, the elephant fell down.
what's the boy doing here?
I don't know why he fell down.
I think he tripped.
he's just a baby.
he tripped over.
so he fell down.
because that's what happened to him.
well, sometimes babies don't know how to walk very well.
even Kirsten.
does she walk?
why doesn't she walk?
what does Kirsten do?
yeah well, that's
this is a baby elephant.
and he probably just learned how to walk.
and that's why he fell down.
what's happening in this picture?
we'll have to go to the San Francisco Zoo then and see all the animals.
ummhm.
what are they doing?
what's this penguin doing?
they are?
what are they doing?
I don't know.
what do you think that seal is doing?
he's trying to lick the boy.
there, he's talking to him.
he's got a big mouth, doesn't he?
oh, he's got an awfully wet tongue.
why does he?
um?
because it's big.
what did he do here?
yeah, that seal's kissing the boy.
they're in the zoo.
in the cage.
he wants to play with the seal.
what is he playing with the seal?
no, they're on the ground there.

what are they doing here?
um?
they're playing ball there, aren't they?
what's happening there?
it's a book all about the zoo.
we got it for you one day when I saw it.
I thought you would like it because I knew you liked the zoo, so
what's happening there?
wow, that must be difficult to do.
oh, only grownups can do that.
people who are lion trainers can do that.
actually that's a lion.
that's pretty dangerous to pick up a lion.
because they could bite you.
because they could bite you.
because he's a lion trainer.
looks like a nice lion though, doesn't he?
he's eating something.
can you tell what it is?
no, I think it's a bone.
what's this little girl saying to him, do you think?
what do you think she's saying?
what would you say if you met a lion?
is that what you would say to the lion?
no.
you wouldn't go inside the cage.
you would stay outside the cage.
I don't know.
that's a strange place for her to be.
that must be a very tame lion.
and the man must have said it was ok to go inside.
she's playing with him.
what kind of a game do you think she wants to play with him?
no, that's the ball.
it's hanging down in front.
what did she attach the ball to?
I see.
so you see what she's doing?
she's dangling the string in front of him.
why do you think?
ummhm.
no, that's not you.
that's another girl.
does that look like you?
I don't know what her name is.
she's a bigger girl then you are.

what's he doing here?
he's looking at a story all about the walrus.
oh, I think the little boy is going for a walk somewhere.
do you go for walks?
where do you like to go for walks?
where?
where else?
do we go for walks in the woods sometime?
yeah and we went to foothill park, remember?
we went on a hike up a hill?
because I like to be outside.
don't you like to be outside?

come here , honey.
Nina, if you want to use water you let me get it because you got
here.
ok.
well, honey, you know what?
let me tell you.
ok, I'll tell you how you can do it.
if you take this I'm goING To bring a little pot and we can wash
because that floor is all wet already.
so here's the wet wash cloth.
and I'll make a little pot.
and we can make a bathtub for the dolly.
ok.
I'll get a little pot.
we're goING To use a little pot.
but we don't wanT To get too much water on
so here we go.
let's be careful not to spill much water on the floor.
put her in the middle.
you can use this to shampoo her with.
like I use for you.
well, where is the other one?
you had two.
where did you put the other one?
you put it away somewhere.
remember?
wait a minute.
you opened one.
in a box, I think.
over there.
look in that box.
I bet you put it in that box over there.
with the black and white spots on it.
find it?
find it?
so how are you going to wash her hair now?
the last one?
she doesn't need any more then that.
ok.
now you give her a good bath.
get her all clean.
uhhuh.
that's a syringe.
I used to use that when you were a little baby when you had ear
ummhm.
when you have an earache.
you can use that for a bottle of shampoo.
here, let's pretend to put the shampoo in here.
ok, it's all full of shampoo.
that's the shampoo bottle.
now what are you doing?
hmm?
where?
hey, you're dripping.
don't drip on your knee.
did you put some shampoo on her head?
and now what are you doing?
you scrubbing?
does she like it?
what is she saying?
would you put
no, we said that was enough.
we have three.
that's plenty.
where's the third one?
what you do with the third one?
hmm?
where'd you put it?
I opened three for you already.
be careful not to get wet on the floor.
now let's

you put it in front of her eyes?
what do you want me to do?
how?
with what?
or with the bucket?
ok, where shall I pour it?
oh, all over her head.
just like I do Nina's hair.
now what?
no, leave the wash cloth in there because you're goING To
I see.
what are you doing now?
putting the shampoo bottle in your mouth?
no, where does the shampoo bottle go?
back in the bag, I guess.
is that where you're going to store it?
hmm?
ok, she must be finished by now.
is she?
did you wash her back and everything?
a bottle in the bathtub?
you don't drink bottles in bathtubs.
you have to dry her first before you give her a bottle.
shall I get you a towel to dry her or does she still need to be
hmm?
oh, there's plenty of water.
look at all the water.
it's all over.
why do you need it full?
what are you goING To do when it's full?
wanT To little more water?
you keep keep the dolly in there and I'll bring a bucket in with
there, that's enough water now.
no, that's plenty.
she'll drown otherwise.
because there'll be too much water.
you don't fill the bathtub up over your neck, do you?
that's enough because you know what would happen?
it would spill all over the rug.
and then we'd have one big wet rug.
I usually fill the bathtub half way up.
just like that pot.
there's about as much.
I'll put some of this in here.
like this, pour it into the bowl.
here we go.
want all the water in the bowl?
ok, be careful.
oh, you're dripping the wash cloth all over the floor.
ok, put the wash cloth back in.
there's plenty in there.
that's too much.
uhoh, honey.
no, don't do that.
that's going to make too much of a mess.
put it back in the bathtub.
woopla.
there we go.
back in the bathtub.
there's plenty of water in the bowl.
Nina, listen carefully.
Nina, if you don't stop

ok.
got to be very gentle.
see, you're spilling it.
there you go.
what are you doing to her hair now?

what are you doing?
you goING To squeeze the water out of the shampoo bottle?
all over her.
where is it falling?
do what?
oh, honey, when you yell like that I willn't do anything.
you have to learn how to ask for things nicely.
doesn't that make a funny bubble?
look at the bubble.
ok, now shall I get you the great big blue towel for her?
still?
how are you goING To do that without getting water all over everything?
you got to what?

that's just a piece of paper that was wrapped around the top of the

there's nothing in there.
that was the top of the teapot.
now why don't you dry dolly and you can give her some things from

that looks pretty.
can you unzip yourself?
yeah, you have to leave your undershirt on.

so let's see.
you wanT To be hot?
let's see.
see if we can get this turtleneck on you.
uhoh, what happened?
oh, where's your face?
what happened to you?

this is such a pretty pair of pants.
can you put them on by yourself?
let's see.
do you know where the green hat is?
I haven't seen the green hat for a long time.
where do you think it finished up?
you're right.
that green hat goes with that.
but I don't know where it is.
let's see if it still fits you.
too tight?
uhoh, what happened?
it's not in there.
I think it's at Nola's .
because I brought an extra hat to Nola's .
so we're goING To stop at Nola's house today and pick up all the
this is a pretty sweater.
no, today you're goING To go with Mommy to Golden_Gate_Park.
and you know what we're goING To go on?
we're goING To go on a merrygoround.
what would you like to ride on on the merrygoround?
sit down.
put on your shoes and socks.
which animal do you think you want to ride on?
I think that there's a great big merrygoround with horses on it
what's your favorite animal to ride on?
a horsie?
remember we went to the zoo?
and there was a merrygoround at the zoo?
and it had all different sorts of animals.
it had lions and it had horses.
I don't know what their merrygoround at Golden_Gate is like.
and maybe we'll go to the tea garden?
you went to the tea garden with Mommy once.
and the aquarium is there.
what would you see at the aquarium, do you think?
I wonder if Elizabeth has been.
Elizabeth is goING To come with us.
here now.
wait a second.
oh, these are new socks.
aren't they pretty?
stand up and see if it fits.
oh, you look very pretty.
here, hold this up.
can you hold that up for me?
hold up the sweater.
I wanT To show you a beautiful doll that I have.
that Nonna sent for you.
straighten up a place for her so we can play with her.
I bet she would like some of your tea.
the tea is not for her?
here's a funny insect.
what is he doing?
wait a minute.
no, Elizabeth is reading.
let me find this other thing and we'll play with it.
and then we'll go to Elizabeth.
come here.
we're going to find something beautiful, I can only find it.
it's a beautiful new dolly.
just for us to play with for a few minutes.
let me see the cricket.
ok, look.
let's twist him.
what can we do with his feet, you think?
where do you think he wants to go?
oh, why don't you take him to the park?
there's the park over there.
show him Golden_Gate_Park.
what is he goING To see first?
where what is he goING To see at the park?
what is he goING To do?
you want him what?
you want him up?
he is?
where is he sliding?
do you think there'll be a slide at the park?
do you know who we're going to go with to San_Francisco?
we're going to go with Anne_Marie.
you met Anne_Marie the other day.
French friend.
what's the cricket doing?
why is he getting cold?
well, let's do something about it.
maybe we can cover him with something.
how about this nice soft blanket.
is it winter?
is that why he's cold?
he's got very funny eyes.
we will.
just a minute.
let me finish up in here.
I wanT To get everything done in here because Elizabeth is talking
now look.
let's find some new shoes for you.
do you know where your new shoes are?
they would look nice with this.
do you know where they are?
maybe in here?
oh, would you like to wear these shoes?
they're at Nola's , I bet.
let's put these brand new ones on.
because you know what?
the red matches the red on your sweater.
the red shoes matches the red design.
see, the red design on your pants.
what should we take along?
is that what you wanT To hold in the park?
well, we can't , we shouldn't probably take the toys into the park.
but you can take them in the car and hold them in the car.
so I have to wear white shoes.
well, we don't have any white shoes but we have red shoes.
I think these'll be ok don't you?
but you have to remind me to stop at Nola's house and get all the
I sure left a lot of clothes over there.
there we go.
no, I wanT To see you.
I think we should make him dance.
crickets like to dance.
ok, in a few minutes.
Elizabeth is busy right now.
I'm going to play with this.
but just here.
would you like to play with it too?
Nonno sent this to you.
we have to be very careful.
we have to keep this doll up there.
the baby's in her arms.
what do you think that is?
she's all dressed up and she has earrings on her ears.
to look pretty.
well, I guess she's probably going to go dancing.
do you like that red dress?
that's the prettiest dolly I've ever seen.
hmm?
those are red shoes like you have.
what color shoes do you have?
well, she has red shoes on too.
let me see.
no, those are shoes.
but you know what happened?
some of the paint has come off and so her toes are coming through.
that's what happened.
she we should keep her in this box.
but you can take her out and give her some tea if you want.
I bet she would like that.
it isn't ?
why?
uhoh, careful, that's a pin.
it's a hat pin.
or hairpin to keep her hair in place.
no, that's an earring.
this is a pin to hold her hair in place.
is it sharp?
on the other ear.
the needle is to hold her hair.
you know sometimes you put your hair up in a bun?
then you have to put something around it.
to keep it up.
otherwise it could fall down.
does she have bangs?
what does she have?
that's a pin and it matches her earrings.
look at her pretty eyes.
they open and shut.
little blue eyes.
that's a pin.
a decoration.
oh, let me see.
I think it's just stuck on.
I think the only thing with a sharp pin is her hairpin.
that's a hairpin.
and that's her hair.
it's a bun.
that's another hairpin.
there isn't one.
only there.
what is she wearing?
let's try to see.
she's wearing so many different things.
that's a real dress.
and what's on top of it?
what's this?
is that an apron, you think?
what's she wearing here?
it's a pretty gold necklace, isn't it?
what?
part of her apron.
I think she is goING To go to the store.
why don't you take her to the store?
you can pretend this is the store.
and where's the lady that would sell at the store?
could this be the lady that sells at the store?
ok.
I'll be the lady at the store.
what would you like to buy?
some oranges?
what kind of oranges?
big ones or little ones?
juicy ones or dry ones?
what are you going to use the oranges for?
who's going to eat them?
just you?
oh, does your baby like oranges?
how will she eat them?
but can she open them?
can she peel them by herself?
you peel them for her?
how come you peel them for her?
because she can't peel them by herself.
ok, how many oranges would you like?
you'd like to split one orange with your baby?
ok, let me go see if I have any oranges.
uhoh.
we're all out of oranges.
what can I give you instead?
we just sold our last orange.
I know you like them, we're going to be getting some more oranges
but before tomorrow what would you like?
would you like some other kind of fruit?
what would you like?
but we don't have any.
would you like to get something else?
some spaghetti.
ok.
what kind of spaghetti?
we have all different kinds.
long thin spaghetti.
we have short macaroni.
we have noodles.
ok, would you like the thinnest kind or would you like the flat spaghetti or would you like a really wide piece of spaghetti?
what kind do you like?
long one or
the long thin one?
ok, let me go get some of that.
I have to go upstairs to get that.
here you go.
that will cost five cents.
can you get the money?
ok, I will need some money before I can give you the spaghetti.
do you have any money in your bag?
ok.
thank you and now I have to give you some change.
how much change do I owe you?
do you know how much I owe you?
I think it must be about three cents.
here we go.
here's your change.
are you going to go to San_Francisco with your child today?
where are you going to take your child?
what are you going to do at the zoo?
really?
is your child big enough to ride on the merrygoround?
on the merrygoround.
are you goING To ride on an animal or on the seat?
you're going to ride on the seat?
I see.
the seat goes round and round and the animals go up and down.
so which are you going to go on?
I know.
