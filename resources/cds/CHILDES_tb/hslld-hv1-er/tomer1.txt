once upon a time there was a little boy named Tim Wheaton and it was Saturday.
and he went and picked up his papa!
and he went all the way out to Wakefield to watch his cousin Wes play baseball.
and who's Wes's sister?
you do too you do too.
and what did Wes have in his yard that's new?
what?
a sandbox.
yeah what else?
and a seesaw.
and a new swimming pool.
and you didn't go in the water but.
you got your feet and your legs wet huh?
yeah but not real deep because it was getting cool.
oh I don't think you did!
I don't think you did.
because it was cool out.
