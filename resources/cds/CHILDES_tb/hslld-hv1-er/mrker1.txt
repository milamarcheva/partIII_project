she wanted to find out do you remember when you went somewhere that you really liked?
why don't you tell her what we did.
the other night.
where did we go?
and tell her all about what happened.
oh that's right.
she wants to know about it.
tell her about it.
diamond ones?
the ones that sparkle silver and flicker as they fall.
zzz oh yeah.
you and that lawn mower Miles.

you don't want to tell her more about it?
