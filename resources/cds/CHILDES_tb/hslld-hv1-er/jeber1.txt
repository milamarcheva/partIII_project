you want to also tell me about what you did at the pond today?
you don't remember?
yup.
something moving?
was it a bug?
you saw mud?
did you stay with Emma the whole time?
who did you walk with?
with strangers?
oh the people that were showing you around the pond?
oh they had radios?
like that radio?
did they talk into the radios?
