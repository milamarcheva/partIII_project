oh.
she goes I'll call her back.
I said okay.
oh yeah no no I didn't even tell her I didn't talk to her all day today.
well the way she said that I assumed that she knew that you were tired.
oh.
so.
uhuh.
I knew you knew your alphabet.
look at this you know what this is?
this is.
a shrimp.
yeah?
that's a shrimp.
that's not a seahorse.
it looks like a seahorse though it's curled around.
those are cute.
you little meatball.
yeah there are seahorses Sabato.
yes there is.
where is this conversation coming from?
what are we talking about the sea for?
from the food we're eating.
boy he has got a one track mind tonight huh?
I haven't seen a seahorse Sabato since I was a little girl.
they used to sell them in what store was that?
Woolworth's or Kresge's or something or Sparks?
what sweetheart what honey?
little tiny seahorses.
they were about the size of a half a dollar.
when Daddy was a little boy we used to go buy them.
little goldfish little seahorses little turtles.
they still sell the goldfish and the turtles but I I haven't seen a little seahorse in well Jesus since I was a little boy and that was a long time ago!
and don't ask me how long. they had a little tail that curls up.
that's right.
do you know what a seahorse eats?
what does a seahorse eat?
a seahorse eats plankton and microbacteria that float around in the ocean.
now you need a special lens or a special pair of glasses to see this microbacteria but it's food for the seahorses.
and the plankton.
and plankton and and microbacteria are just about the same.
and that's where they get all of their nourishment from.
now a shark is a bigger animal a bigger fish I should say and that eats a shark will eat other fish.
but not all fish.
listen listen to Daddy.
not all fish eat other fish.
there are some fish that don't eat other fish.
do you understand me?
some fish just eat plankton and like that microbacteria that I'm telling you about.
see.
that's right.
they they peck they nibble on plants and stuff like that.
and they that's right!
well, they're all fish.
a fish has to stay in the water.
now you know what a dolphin is don't you?
a dolphin doesn't have to stay in the water all of the time.
a dolphin can come up a dolphin is a mammal.
and a mammal they live in the ocean but they can breath our air.
a whale big big whale?
see the big whales?
like in Pinnochio the big whale?
that's a mammal.
it's not a fish.
it lives in the ocean like a fish but.
it's a mammal and.
it can breath our air.
a fish can't breath our air.
they have to breath the air that they make in the water.
you understand now?
alright.
this summer we're going to be going to the.
Debbi!
Debbi!
yeah?
I'm trying to put a tape on.
the aquarium we're going to go to the aquarium.
remember Daddy took you to the aquarium and the.
dolphin show?
well we're going to go again this year because you're a little bigger and you understand more and you'll they'll have seahorses there and you'll be able to see one.
how's that?
a boy is never alive if he's made out of wood.
you understand me?
alright.
Pinnochio is just a movie.
movies are make believe.
they're fictional.
they do make movies that are based on you know true life events but for the most part the things that you see on television are fictional.
in other words it's make believe.
okay?
Debbi I'd love a cup of coffee.
want some milk?
mhm.

why why do you want to punch?
no if someone hits him he wants to punch.

yeah you don't stand there and let somebody beat on you neither but naturally you defend yourself only if you have to.
