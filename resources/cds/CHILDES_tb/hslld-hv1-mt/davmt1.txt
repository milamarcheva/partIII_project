the batteries.
I don't think the batteries are any good.
well we'll just have to see.
I hope they are!
alright.
not too far.
they're alright.
is that red light on?
yeah.
it's voice activated.
oh it is?
yes.
how's your supper?
oh did you get your drink?
okay.
it is.
because look.
yeah I know but I'm just trying to see if the tape is going around.
it is.
I already tried.
yeah.
right now so don't drink a lot okay?
save some and don't eat all the cantaloupe.
eat some of your eat some of your other stuff okay?
okay?
so cut it out.
you might as well squish that down a little bit.
well
don't .
don't squish it so hard that it comes out!
yeah.
good supper huh?
hey move up close!
what's the matter?
your stomach hurts?
well eat slowly.
chew up your food really good okay?
well if it hurts that much just eat your cantaloupe.
don't eat you know too much.
don't make it hurt more okay?
well don't eat fast!
he's not.
he's going to eat slow.
want some broccoli?
it's delicious!
lemon!
all the nice florets.
like little trees!
you can pretend you're a giant!
was that me?
my gosh.
sensitive isn't it?
yeah.
well we were just checking out the little red light on it.
watch your juice.
like when you talk it goes on.
see?
so.
see?
now if you say something watch.
it gets brighter as you talk.
that was my ice cube.
that little squeal was my ice cube.
tell Daddy what you did today what we did today.
sure you do.
well we didn't do too much.
what did we do?
we played some games.
what games did we play?
mhm.
didn't we play Fish?
who won?
who won let's see.
first time we played Chutes and Ladders
who won?
I think so.
and then we we we played Memory Game.
who won that?
mhm.
you won?
yeah he's really good at the Memory game.
mhm.
mhm. mhm.
and we watched Lady and the Tramp, huh?
well.
see every time you talk that little red light comes on.
when it's not playing music.
it's recording what we're talking about.
I think that was all we played.
mhm. oh yeah.
did we play Fish twice?
I think we just played one time.
here have some more sandwich.
yeah?
want some.
that's nice.
want to try some chicken?
I love you too.
it's really good.
oh yeah.
well here have some more of your.
right!
you ate a whole bunch of it that time didn't you?
have some more.
sandwich then Chi.
no.
here.
have some more food you you might.
I don't think that's what gave you the tummyache because that was kind of a long time ago and you just got your tummyache now.
that was a couple of weeks ago that you ate that chicken.
it doesn't take a few weeks to get a tummyache.
have some more.
you could have a tummyache because you're hungry.
because you haven't been eating.
here don't you want some more of that?
well I'm almost done so.
don't eat too fast.
just have some more of that anyway.
you better start eating then.
even though he seemed to feel better today I'm glad I kept him out of day care.
mhm.
he still seemed to be you know kind of huh?
right!
or your fever.
well that's what when you feel when your skin feels real hot.
that's a fever.
it's really hard to understand you when you talk with food in your mouth though okay?
well yeah it's pretty warm in here.
it's not that bad.
are you hot?
oh Chi not the fan!
it'll cool it'll cool our meal off too quickly.
come on Chi you're making a mess.
will you please sit down?
thank you.
it's too cold to have that on anyway.
good sandwich though huh?
what are you doing?
you're all done?
don't you want any cantaloupe?
well if it hurts your tummy to eat then don't eat but you may not have anything else.
this will make your tummy feel better probably Chi.
now I'm not going to get any.
because you haven't eaten and so that's why your tummy's probably doesn't feel very good because you don't have any food.
that wouldn't be bad news.
oh!
uhoh.
one sick pony.
you want to lie down on the couch for a little while?
oh no!
not now.
Chi once a day you can watch it alright?
not ten times a day.
no you don't !
it's nice to just have quiet around here for once.
well while I'm eating I want quiet.
yes.
don't you even want your delicious cantaloupe?
nice juicy cantaloupe?
why don't you drink your juice at least?
I'm afraid you're becoming dehydrated.
you're going to get too skinny.
your little muscles will go away if you don't eat though!
they'll shrink!
mhm.
oh gee!
that I could live without.
that's not even water is it?
well
I don't have work tomorrow and you don't have day care so we'll just hang out again in the house and then hopefully you'll be all better for Friday.
because Friday I have to go to work.
on Friday?
yeah.
and you have day care and it's toy day on Friday and you can bring a toy.
well toy day's not until the day after tomorrow Chi.
I guess it requires a lot of thought.
what?
picking out a toy.
oh.
you could bring your Superman cape again.
I don't know bring it in.
I can't see.
yeah!
yeah.
if you didn't scare anybody with it but sure.
where did we get that anyway?
do you remember?
on the Cape was it?
down in Provincetown I think?
I think.
oh!
it was in Provincetown?
mhm.
oh yeah!
looks like it has got a big smile doesn't it?
maybe hey!
maybe it'll eat the rest of your cantaloupe.
oh okay.
maybe that wasn't such a good idea was it?
can I have this thing?
had a hankering for egg salad did you?
it looks so good all the egg salad's popping out of the sandwiches.
well they'll shrink if you keep this up.
you didn't eat hardly anything yesterday and you shertainly certainly didn't eat hardly anything today.
had about three bites of breakfast.
had about two bites of lunch.
and two bites of supper.
well there's two more bites.
whoa!
but I guess if you're not throwing up or anything.
I guess that's okay.
what?
Jesse has a robot hand?
Jesse at school?
right.
that's what I figured.
a robot hand?
is that what you said?
well that's what I figured.
what's that like?
it's just a hand?
does that do anything?
it can do that!
oh well that's pretty handy!
mhm.
well we'll see.
if we see it in the store.
if it's cheap.
have extra money.
and you're being really unbelievably good.
and I'm inclined to buy you something.
that I don't like at all.
because I don't think it's funny and I don't think it's the correct thing to do at the dinner table or at your mother.
I don't know.
it just bothers me.
pretending to shoot somebody isn't really a nice thing.
well it looks like it.
a telescope?
oh!
okay well look don't eat anymore with your mouth full of food because it's hard to understand.
okay?
don't talk anymore?
don't talk anymore with your mouth full of food okay?
makes me mad!
are you going to eat your cantaloupe?
oh great!
here dip dip it in your juice and see what it tastes like.
son of a gun huh?
who are you trying to kill anyways?
why?
too loud?
is that the guy on the motorcycle?
oh.
must be because it's loud, huh?
I think so.
is there a little red light that goes on?
I think it is.
then we're going to mail it.
remember those two young women that came over?
and they asked me a whole bunch of questions?
oh yeah.
alright well maybe you shouldn't play with that because I don't know if the on it really
okay but it's not ours.
is what I'm trying to say.
okay?
we sort of borrowed it from them.
right.
Kennan and Lisa?
Kennan and Lisa right?
don't you think that's yeah I know it was Lisa.
yeah and.
right!
that's right!
exactly we.
and we pretended that we were having breakfast in the cafeteria at school huh?
oh my gosh I'm losing count!
wait a minute now you want a robot hand
and what else?
oh right!
cups and a saucer.
sort of like you own dishes set of dishes huh?
oh gosh!
how many?
I have to buy ten toys now?
but your birthday was only a month ago!
and Christmas isn't for five more months!
uhoh.
sure.
oh gosh yeah.
sure I'll buy you ten toys sometime.
here you want some more of this cantaloupe Chi?
orange food is almost as good as green food to eat.
huh?
you want more broccoli?
huh?
I'll bring you some broccoli.
it's good!
it's like eating a little tree!
you will?
Chi wants to try a little tree of broccoli.
oh he does huh?
yeah!
good I'll bring him some to eat.
because at school they told me that you always try new food.
but you willn't do that here!
you always tell me that you eat your salad and your carrots and peas.
alright.
yes?
okay.
wow!
hey Chi come on in here!
go on in there I'll bring you a piece of it.
here come on.
wow!
okay here's a little.
come on!

here's a little piece of tree for you.
a piece of broccoli.
okay.
wow!
did you see how high he threw that?
okay here try this.
it's higher!
okay.
why don't you sit down and try that broccoli now?
he's not exactly sitting down.
no no.
that's that's for me.
we'll do it we'll eat it together.
ready?
go!
Chi you didn't even get your mouth around it.
how do you know?
well what happened?
it didn't even touch your tongue!
how do you know you don't like it!
what happened?
you didn't like the top?
why you didn't like the way it feels or
what about the taste?
did you like the taste?
I don't think you even.
like the color?
oh boy they feel kind a puny today!
I think they shrank a tiny bit.
I think they got a little smaller because you haven't been eating very well lately.
watch now why don't you let's try it again.
put that one put that one back in your mouth.
give it another try.
you didn't even let it try!
you didn't even bite it!
got it?
Chi.
watch.
not at the dinner table.
even Daddy eats that!
give it a try.
it has got candy inside.
I didn't want to have to tell you that but
yeah.
yeah chewy Tootsie Roll.
you know those lollipops that you eat and then there's chocolate inside?
that's sort a what it's like.
he's not buying that line.
what did he say?
chocolate gives him a tummyache?
yeah.
clever.
yes you do!
you don't like it now.
you don't like chocolate broccoli?
you only want chocolate cake?
well it has got chocolate cake sprinkled inside it.
well you're not going to eat it then? someday when you get a little older I think you'll like all kinds of stuff.
I think it held this one.
look how.
yeah.
you know what?
ow!
yes.
your muscles are very strong.
well, they will if you don't eat!
you're going to get all skinny if you don't eat.
and your muscles the only way they can develop and get bigger is for you to give it give them some food.
jeepers!
oh!
you mean I have to eat!
then you're going to start shrinking and your teeth will fall out.
and your fingernails will fall out.
stop it!
that's if you don't eat for a long long time.
well are you done?
so.
are you done?
yeah.
I'm done.
let's clean up now.
no.

no.
I because I know that you're going to start eating again pretty soon.
I think you feel better.
