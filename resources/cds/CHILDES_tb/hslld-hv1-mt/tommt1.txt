I'll cut it off.
you have a fork.

there's butter on your potatoes
butter on your corn
yeah?
yeah well it's lamb chop.
yes.
yes!
isn't it delicious even if it's not on the cob?
that's because it's corn Chie.
corn grows!
in a great big tall stalks.
like we see at Allendale farm?
great big tall stalks.
and then this is the Chie of year it grows all summer long and this Chie of year you get to pick it.
well we're going to have a ride in the country this weekend.
I bet we'll see some corn fields.
and I'll show you.
they're real nice.
they're great big tall stalks that grow way up high.
the sports.
what are they playing?
would you like to be moved up to the table.
little bit?
yeah!
is that a little better?
you're welcome honey.
yeah?
please don't spill your milk.
it's right under your hand there.
well I think that you could possibly put it somewhere else.
see the helicopter?
that would be terrible if it was a missile.
what could happen if it was a missile?
oh well that's a scary thought.
I'm sure happy it was just a helicopter.
I'm buttering my corn.
I like mine on the cob because I have my teeth!
you'd like to try to bite well it's still pretty hot how about when it cools down a little?
okay in the meanchie you can eat yours.
you can right about.
how is it?
how is it?
how is it?
just pretty good isn't it great or maybe even delicious?
well thank you honey.
you're a good son.
well I think Nelson likes lamb chops too but the kitty has his own food.
what darling?
well that's your jaw going up and down but no thank you I I'd rather not put my finger in your ear.
I'd like to eat my dinner I know you're chewing very good come on!
I want you to chew please.
no not particularly I'd like you to get in the chair though.
that's your jaw moving inside your ear.
he's on the other side of the screen that's a pretty big bee though huh?
I think we'd probably get him first but we're not bothering him so I think we're just going to him.
would you eat some dinner please?
well I think that bees kind of like honey.
what?
over your plate please.
yeah I told you it was hot.
I wasn't kidding huh?
it's good though.
try the end the end is is a little cooler.
yeah the end right here.
how about I save you some and in the meanchie you eat some of yours too.
well it's not all gone it just melted onto your corn honey and now your corn's all buttery.
it exploded where?
disappeared?
no honey.
kitty's not supposed to bother us at the supper table.
nobody locked it?
must have locked it.
hey so did you have breakfast with papa today?
what did you have?
yeah?
yeah?
sounds like a good size breakfast to me.
papa cooks breakfast real good huh?
could can do what?
he's he's on the ledge so he's okay.
oh yeah I remember that.
I don't think so.
daddy just did that that one Chie because he was being funny.
I know but I think it might get messy honey no spraying water in my bedroom window please.
know what I use that for?
that's for when you cook the lamb chops on the barbecue somechies the fire gets real strong and burns them so I spray the fire with that and it's gone.
and they don't get too burnt.
yeah that's right.
fire go right out.
what?
yeah.
you having trouble getting the corn on your spoon?
you're doing pretty good at.
yeah that's okay.
you know what else might be easier?
if you just do it sideways and make it crash into your mashed potatoes and you won't chase them all over.
to what?
fork and a spoon okay?
how do you like eating on the back porch?
we haven't done this in a while huh?
know what made me remember?
you mentioned it last night that you'd like to eat on the back porch.
and that gave me an idea!
think maybe you need to drink your milk honey.
what tape were you watching in the living room before dinner?
mhm.

I didn't know that.

yep.
it's just right now.
you can hold it.
try to bite up with your bottom teeth.
any better?

not with butter.
you just put it in the pan all by yourself cover it up and then cook it for about eight minutes.

alright.
I promise.
you're going to stay in bed the whole night?
that's the first thing you're going to do?
uhhuh.
yeah?
late in the morning does that mean you're not going to wave goodbye to me out the window?
that's pretty early!
that's seven thirty.
oh okay.
so you know what you could do?
you could get up and wave to me out the window and then go back to bed.
why?
I see.
mhm.
I would bet.
you know why?
remember what their house is made out of their fort?
do you remember what it was?

I'm sure you would be excited but momma does not like to camp in the woods.\
your daddy likes to camp in the woods.

the monster grabbed you on your head but that didn't come true no monster really grabbed you on your neck.
it did?
when?
yeah?
come on I'd just like you to finish it.
it did?
no honey it didn't come true.
you know I would never let any monsters get you.
besides what did I tell you about monsters?
they're only make believe and they only live in movies because somebody with a wonderful imagination makes up monsters.
and all other sort of special effects to make the really scary monsters you know like how you watch Michael Jackson?
and they show him putting his makeup on for Thriller?
that's just because somebody had a great imagination.
but no there's no such things as monsters.
there's some scary creatures like lions very fierce and scary.
but.
we're safe from them.
what?
excuse me?
Nelson please get down.

well honey he jumped up on the dinner table he's just being a bad kitty tonight I gave him a whole bunch of treats and he's not letting us eat our dinner.
I know but I guess he has.
I know he wants to eat everything that's why he got pushed on the floor.
and if he wants to see us I guess he'll just have to sit on the floor and look up.
