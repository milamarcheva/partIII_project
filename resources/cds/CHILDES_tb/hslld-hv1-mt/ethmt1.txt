alright please color something while you're waiting for your food?
alright.
you may while just while I cut up the meat.
pull it out.
did he only sing this in the encore last night?
I'm sorry?
did he only sing this in the encore?
I don't know.
I'm just wondering where it is in the concert.
I'd have a tape.
for the audio tape.
I think the tops of this is six.
stand by.
and the tension just might be out.
this.
so I have to put the rest of it on the you have to start on the second side of the tape too.
lose more of of Philip Flack than anything else.
right.
the second side is the side that I had the encores on the encore on.
so I have to get that to be able to use my little cassette.
I'll do that right now.
okay.
Suzanne's sister did the New York bit?
and biscuits.
thanks.
sorry Harve.
that's okay.
do you want some Quick?
yeah.
do you want strawberry or chocolate?
so how's the chicken look?
yeah.
and you're using your new placemat.
yeah I thought he might want to try his new placemat.
there.
okay.
pardon?
so you'd like something over it.
Daddy's going to put it in your dinosaur.
no.
well I figured since you have your dinosaur placement might as well have your dinosaur cup.
so I'll wash this for another time.
I don't know.
yeah.
okay.
I think it's .
these little points.
oh they're supposed to be like grass and plants and things like that in the the landscape all around the dinosaurs.
but right here they look sharp don't they?
there you go.
warm.
what?
the chicken is should be pretty cool.
I'll cut that one and the next one you have I won't cut you can just eat it because it will be cooled off.
I knew Bro wouldn't make it home I hope he made it to the library
oh I wouldn't .
on time to get to work done because it's so early he's first.
his twenty dollars that he got for his birthday yesterday.
is burning in his pocket already.
yeah.
it's been.
that's why he didn't need money to come home from the library yesterday he said I'll have enough to.
yeah.
I'm afraid the chicken is not as well cooked as as usual.
well it's it's probably better cooked than the biscuits though.
I don't know.
well they'll both be nice and tender on the inside.
well I told Nathaniel that going out to barbecue saves more of a symbolic cash than after it was started barbecuing season.
just to celebrate the first day of spring.
how's the chicken Munchkin?
yeah.
it takes awhile.
because you just can't turn the coals on.
like you do an oven.
but when you cook it in the oven it doesn't taste this good.
excuse me I'm going to check the
here a napkin.
yeah.
mhm.
it all fit on the tape?
you got lucky.
yes.
do you have to use the bathroom, Honey?
okay.
oh.
they wriggle in their seats in Nathaniel land?
does it have rickety chairs?
why don't we turn the sound and it off.
okay thank you.
you're welcome.
oh you spilled a little bit?
okay well it's just a little.
you you got the napkin there fast.
the biscuits the biscuits aren't burned.
they're just about the way they they're supposed to be.
oh really?
yeah.
I guess the reason I was going to take them out before is because I I like them better.
under done?
not under done but done just right.
well it's just that light golden brown across the top.
that's not light golden brown.
it's medium golden brown.
but it's not burnt.
well
the other way the mushy part is supposed to be flaky.
yeah that's true.
I liked it.
true when mushy then I can't separate these little layers.
mhm.
what?
those calendars?
what this?
these barbecued calendars?
you want to eat the calendar?
when did you eat a calendar?
in what in what month would you start eating?
Nathaniel are you sure you don't have to go to the bathroom?
if you have to go to the bathroom come back and have food to eat after that.
alright.
go peepee.
that's how they sit Nathaniel down.
just to avoid confrontation.
oh the chicken's .
it is overdone but it's still it's barbecued.
yeah.
and it would be very unhealthy to have that like that all the time.
what the hell it's the first day of spring.
usually the first barbecue of the year the chicken isn't cooked right it takes a couple times in the warm weather.
in the warm weather you can still cook it and just stay out there with the barbecue.
yeah.
in the cold weather you say let's cook this sucker fast.
the sky is all overcast and today is the night that I was telling Melanie about the sky.
it's not overcast.
no?
no.
oh.
because when I looked out the window up front the sky was all gray.
we just watched the sun set.
yeah?
maybe we can go out tonight and see if we can notice where Mars and Venus and the Pleiades moon are.
there's no school today.
there's no one there to answer the phone.
it's Sunday.
they're all home eating.
even the teachers.
they're not going to go to school when they don't have to.
they have families too you know that.
you know Gail has a son and Karen has a son.
blow your nose please.
blow.
that's what I heard it alright.
well I think Karen is probably home with Christopher right now.
well shouldn't shouldn't he have his Mummy home with him on one day a week?
or two?
aren't you sad when your Mummy goes to work?
aren't you sad when your Mummy goes to work?
oh!
yeah.
I'll wait until after dinner then.
I I wanted to talk too much instead of eating.
okay eat up.
no toys at our table.
no toys at our table.
Dylan's in his last minute thing again.
he said he couldn't use the emotional side because he his part of the was very specific.
what.
it was on the economics of it.
Brendan you really should have done this before.
don't put that near your ear.
that's very sharp.
oh yuck.
I don't want
Nathaniel no.
don't swing your head around while you're eating.
are you drinking your Quick?
I mean between bites.
no swinging the head.
Daddy.
and so what did you think of the presents that Mac and Melanie gave you.
well we didn't see them at Christmas time.
because every time they were going to come down here they had snow and every time we were going to go up there the weather was bad so we had to wait until yesterday to see them and so we gave we gave Michael his birthday present because we gave them their Christmas present before Christmas.
yeah.
we well.
we gave her her birthday present Honey in August when she had her birthday.
and we gave her her Christmas present before Christmas and what they gave you was your Christmas present yesterday.
but Michael's birthday was in January.
yeah.
and we never saw him in January so that's why he got his present yesterday.
Melanie remembers that we gave her present before.
because your birthday is coming up next month.
last year they did.
mhm.
you know your your video tapes with cartoons on them?
which cartoons were they?
I don't know Bugs Bunny and things like that.
mhm.
those were from Michael and Melanie and they give you the sweatshirt that a sweatshirt that you wore yesterday and they've given you other presents too.
but those are the ones I remember.
yes yes.
that's right they gave you that the tape.
mhm.
the pin cushion man who pops the balloons?
what about him?
yeah.
no it's not.
you mean tell him not to pop the balloons?
okay.
you can tell him too you know.
yeah.
except it's a cartoon Than.
I I don't think he'll stop popping balloons because on the video he's always on the video.
popping balloons!
and and don't the balloons win in the end?
don't the balloons win in the end?
don't they find their way to get rid of the pin cushion man?
do they?
I forget.
maybe we'll have to watch the cartoon again soon to see how.
yeah.
no he can't pop their balloons any more like that.
oh.
good memory Nathaniel I didn't remember that part.
yeah.
do you want another piece of.
want another piece of chicken?
it has a lot of bone.
mhm.
let us see if I I know.
here here you go.
sorry.
oh that's alright.
I like to wrap the biscuits and have chicken and biscuits.
not me.
I want to eat dinner.
I think we should eat instead of playing television don't you think?
can you turn your television off for a couple of minutes?
oh good.
can you put it away?
alright.
it's about seven minutes to six.
what noise?
I think it's the fan that you must hear.
no the refrigerator just kicked on.
oh.
never mind.
well tough.
oh don't say that because if the refrigerator stops everything that's in the freezer will thaw and it will not be any good and everything that's in the refrigerator will get warm and it willn't be cold anymore.
we have to keep everything cold in the refrigerator.
that's why we have a refrigerator.
and it makes that noise because it's working right.
and it's a quiet noise.
Dylan is probably at the library until they're closed.
you think so?
yeah.
when he left here it was after two.
yeah.
and he's going to Earling's house today.
yeah.
and you know he probably didn't get to the library before three thirty.
probably not.
the library closes at
five thirty.
five five thirty.
five or five thirty.
I'm sorry I didn't get it.
he was saying if the library wasn't open that's alright.
other kids will be done with the books they took out of the library and and I can look at them and mine.
so social studies isn't the first thing they had in mind.
Nathaniel you're crazy?

Ireland has a very low
rate.
West Berlin has an astronomical rate but the rest of West Germany doesn't have a a huge rate.
what is it Honey?
yes.
Honey we don't have time to make a cake tonight.

and we have other sweets.
I think I have a can of cat food I bought for Brook and I have that present that I got him?

I just got him that orange one.
so we can sing happy birthday to him and we can eat our own sweets.
we can give him the can of catfood.
it's a new flavor that they make.
and he'll have to share his with Liz.
no it's cat food.
it's a new flavor I got him.
