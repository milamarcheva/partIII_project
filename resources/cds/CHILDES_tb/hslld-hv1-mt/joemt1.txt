I shouldn't have asked you.
I shouldn't have offered.

oh God terrible huh?
I know.
I'll go turn it off because Chi's missing it anyway.
we'll watch it after you eat.
you won't miss it!
and then you can turn it right back on.
it doesn't go over it's a tape.
no you'll see it right where she shut it off it'll go right back on.
that's the good thing about it.
you don't miss any.
if you have to go out you just turn it off and when you come back you pick up from where it was on before.
I'll tell you this.
alright.
I don't believe May's not home.
should go chasing after her.
is Jessie coming back there with her?
well Jessie's mother was going to either pick her up here or at the park.
and she was going to pick her up at five thirty.
so I imagine her mom's going to give May a ride home and I imagine she must be picking her up about now otherwise it's all screwed up.
have to have a talk with her about not coming home.
she doesn't have a watch on but still an hour's a big difference from a half an hour.
what?
I told her I was there at quarter of five and I said come home at five I mean in a half an hour.
yeah well she don't know a half hour.
she ought to carry a watch around with her.
she has a watch.
