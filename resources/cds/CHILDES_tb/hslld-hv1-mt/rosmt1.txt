I'll use my fork.
put your leg down honey.
yeah I'll get you some.
oh the orange ones too?
hello cuddly poo.
no just orange and white there you go.
crack a window get a little fresh air.
not so much cold air.
oh I'm right against the window.
it's not cold.
did you dad!
I'll get it.
dad did you have that emergency meeting at the library?
yeah we did!
what'd they say?
this is!
wait a minute I'll tell ya.
well I don't know if you know the story of what's going on in the last day or two.
well I heard what you told mom last night.
Govenor Dukakis is slashing the state budget.
I saw it on the news report.
well according to what the head honcho at the library said.
the Govenor cut the state's aid to the cities and towns.
the state gives money to the cities and towns because by two hundred and ten billion dollars.
and Worcester's share of that is about eleven million dollars.
so the city manager called in all the department heads like the head chief head of the library and all that stuff and said we're going to have to make some cuts.
he wanted them by Monday noon time three days from now to submit a new budget and to tell him what services they provided and how much those estimated services cost.
and the cuts that are going to be made will probably be personnel cuts because they don't feel that they can cut that much more in way of equipment and stuff like that.
but everybody would feel the cuts.
lower no one place would be singled out library police and fire department probably won't be exempt.
it's not clear whether everybody would feel the cuts equally.
so the particular place that I'm funded under is funded directly by the state but it goes through the city.
we've gotten our funding but it may not that may not protect my job.
and because the city.
decides who gets money for what where.
so.
picture is looking grimmer.
you know I could come back from vacation and find a computer letter in my paycheck.
because they're going to try to do this in the next few weeks.
because the sooner they can do it the more over the year they can spread it out over if they wait six months then they have to make a big cut last.
that's for me right?
yep.
what does Chi want you want steak or chicken Chi.
so!
he asked if anybody had any questions and everybody just sat there.
honey use your fork next time.
stunned to absorb the news.
no you have to have a little meat.
you have to have one now what would you.
what would you do if they cut your job?
collect unemployment unless I found another one.
hopefully I'd find another one hopefully I'll find another one before they cut it.
okay you can have both.
begin to search more seriously.
oh cucumbers are good.
so give you notice before they cut the jobs couple of weeks?
yeah probably something like two months.
although if they want to make these cuts as soon as possible I don't know.
to what extent they think.
they're going to try to make another possible because.
they maybe just.
or they can just.
give you job I mean it's not unheard of.
see you later.
you get paid on Wednesday and you take the last.
what?
what happened was the city doesn't have as much money.
oh I am.
the city doesn't have as much money and so they have to look to see how they can save money.
one of the ways they may try to save money is by taking people's jobs away.
which means that that person wouldn't have a job.
I haven't worked there very long and so my job might be one of the ones that taken away.
have to find a new job.
I don't know yet that I do but I may have to so I've been starting to look in the paper for other jobs.
that would be nice.
I want a job that's interesting to do and that pays me as much as I make now or more.
you okay?
be president.
of what?
of the United States.
I wouldn't want that job.
hundred thousand dollars a year.
that's not very that's not very much.
famous.
more than you're making now.
for all well that's true.
still not very much for all the headaches you have to put up with.
I mean there're company presidents who make four times that amount and do half as much work.
you could be a C_E_O of A_T_T.
what's that?
why?
because what?
did something happen at school today?
what happened?
oh how come he was crying so much?
maybe Jeffery was having a bad day.
would you not tear your napkin up like that?
oh!
how did he break the bike?
and he broke it?
so they didn't want him to go on a bike this time because he broke one last time.
so how come you don't want to go to your school anymore because of that?
you don't have any?
oh?
but you have good days too?
you had a good day yesterday right?
wouldn't you miss all your friends?
wouldn't you miss Danielle?
well if you didn't go there you wouldn't see Danielle.
to your school.
college?
sure they might wind up going out together and going to college together.
in twenty years!
well.
you could?
maybe you will grow up and you and her will go to the same college.
talking about college already.
hey never hurts to plan ahead.
everybody probably goes someday right?
everybody a lot of people don't .
talk about.
going to school at daycare?
talk about going to bigger schools?
can I have the other piece of chicken?
it's good chicken I like it.
can I have the pasta salad?
I made it.
well!
by now you should be an expert at it.
