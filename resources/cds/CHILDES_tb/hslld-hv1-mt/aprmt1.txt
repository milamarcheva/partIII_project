and I had a diet Sprite for lunch.
and this right here be my dinner right here.
and tomorrow I'll drink this for lunch.

I'm a try to get back to in the habit like I had a few years ago while you was used to do it in my house four and five days a week steadily.
year in and year out.
it was it was just a way of life.
but I mean but then I got out of the habit when I got work and got lazy and used to do it at least four or five days a week every day.
and see that was good cause it kept it kept it down good.
never on never on the weekends.
and then I used to have Elka come over here and do it with me.
but she never did come.
but I was just in that habit of every day.
and ever since my mat that I used to do it on.
my hospital egg crate thing got tore up.
and I tried on the floor a couple of time and my backbone'd be digging into the floor.
that's horrible.
and I wish and I tried on the bed but the bed is too soft.
