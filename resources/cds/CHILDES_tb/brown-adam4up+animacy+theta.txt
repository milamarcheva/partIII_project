he's all tired out.
his name is Rinny from Rin_tin_tin.
see, he's just playing, honey.
he doesn't want to chase you.
that's alright.
he doesn't want to bother you.
well, Rinny, come on in here.
is that a good song?
what were you singing?
what about all those things in that basket?
shall we just take the basket outside?
what about those things?
aren't they toys?
so it be a what?
a what?
a buttomc?
what is that?
what way?
he's looking around?
you're a silly silly boy.
oh, what is that?
a yoyo.
can you use it?
you put the string in here.
Paul was watching and his head was going up and down.
when you get it down you have to jerk it a little so it will come.
oh yes, you can.
now pull it.
no.
what're you doing over in the corner, Paul?
it takes time to learn how to use it properly.
yes, you did a little.
yes, it's very easy to get off.
what?
what?
what does that mean?
that's the name of the toy.
yes, it's my turn.
yes.
some what?
some glasses.
now pull it up.
Paul, stop.
yes, so it willn't be difficult to get it out.
put it on your middle finger.
how did you hurt it?
because it's easier to do I think.
probably.
just pull it straight up, alright.
yes, that's all you have to do.
because those are pretty colors.
oh yes, I think you're getting it.
oh yes, when you're learning things you have to miss sometimes.
what?
you just what?
what kind of work do you do?
oh, it's your business.
no, don't pull them, Adam.
good, Adam.
almost.
pull the string up.
oh, you have big glasses.
I think Paul would like to see you.
oh, you are?
oh, I'm green?
oh, I don't mind.
when you take the glasses off am I still green?
Paul doesn't know what to think about you.
let him have a turn, alright?
alright.
it's your turn.
that was long ago.
what light?
who's in your chair?
you did what?
you did what, Adam?
did you try to open it?
I don't think that duck can drive very well.
I don't think that duck can drive very well.
he knocked the pig off and ran over the goat.
he's a dangerous driver.
I don't think that's sixty four.
his mother locked the door?
why?
oh no, I saw it.
the duck didn't get hurt, did he?
oh, he doesn't know where he's driving?
no, you have that and Paul is playing with that.
Paul is playing with the trailer because you had the barn.
oh, I don't know.
I should think you could find a parking space almost any place.
he what?
oh, now he's a very good driver?
you're caught by a fish?
is that brown one a duck too?
yes, since Paul's playing with the barn.
look, Adam.
yes, Paul had the glasses on.
I don't think he'll let me.
yes.
how did you break your window?
what window?
where?
I don't think I understand what you're talking about?
you mean the windshield like that?
on the car?
oh yes, I don't know where that is.
what light?
oh yes.
I'm sure it must be on.
you let him use that while you're driving the car?
yes.
I guess he was just measuring the string to see how long it was.
you don't want anything in there?
this is a real microscope.
microscope.
don't you want to look through here first?
mmhm.
we need a small mirror.
no, a tiny mirror.
we need something to look at.
we could use a hair.
because we're going to look at it under a microscope.
I didn't bring him.
he came by himself.
he came in through the open door.
Rinny, no no.
no, I see some big ropes.
Paul, no no.
can you look through that hole?
no, look through the hole, honey.
did you see it?
it's what you call a mechanical toy, yes.
no no.
it does what?
oh, I suppose it's something you can make.
different things, different shapes.
a what?
a fish cart?
why do you lock the animals up at night?

that's one.
two, three.
oh, you mean a crown.
you mean a fish net.
oh, what will she do.
poor little cow.
oh, very good.
why don't you just sit on your bed.
that's a doggie, isn't it?
oh, he's swinging.
oh very.
careful of my long white beard.
do you live on a farm?
yes.
what's your name?

I never saw a dragon on a farm before.
do you live in a barnyard?
yes.

yes.
I'm a mommy chicken and I've got seventeen baby chicks.

I've never seen you on my farm.
oh, where's your farm?
oh, I see.

don't you eat my chickens.
you're a funny little boy.
Mr Dragon, you don't like blocks?
ice.
do you get ice on the farm?
oh no, that's my beard.

it looks like a cow but I've never seen a cow with a beard.
it's a bull?
you've never seen one of those?
oh, you have so.
let's put these up first.
I don't bring water in my bag.
why?
I couldn't carry it.
it would spill all over.
yes.
what did you do?
no.
because then you can't paint.
no no, he's not bothering you.
he's just looking.
maybe Adam would like to paint his popsicle sticks.
here they all are.
dip the brush in paint lots of times so it's one color.
you could do all those colors.
roll it around until you get a good color.
oh yes.
put it back in the yellow.
you get nice thick colors.
oh, that's pretty, Adam.
oh, that's very pretty, Adam.
yes, that's very very pretty, Adam.
no no, you can't have the paint.
no I don't think he needs it.
that would spoil the paints.
it's not a tricycle stick.
it's a popsicle stick.
you did.
the people in the factory where they make the popsicles put the
and then you eat frozen whatever it is.
and then they throw the popsicle stick away.
yes.
no, they shouldn't throw it on the sidewalk at all, should they?
that's where we found those.
that's right.
is that what you do?
you do it.
what kind?
you mean what color?
did you make me blue?
know what that color is?
is it?
I think it's brown too.
you may leave them there.
here's your can.
here's another one.
don't use so much water.
don't you need some color?
what is it?
that's right.
alright.
how colored they are.
why don't you count them?
it doesn't have any paint on?
why didn't you put any paint on?
wait, Adam, don't pull the bag in the water.
have you finished with the paint?
yes.
I'm a nice what?
oh no.
oh no.
they're alright just like dat.
what are you looking for?
that's right.
I thought you'd seen one of those before.
careful, don't pull it so hard.
alright.
would you like to see how many of these we found, Adam?
I don't know if there's a whole set or not.
it's to draw.
you need paper.

that's only one car.
watch what you're doing.
is that what you do?
look here.
you willn't have any green ones, will you?
no no, don't pull on the book, Paulie.

you can put them in all different directions.
a direction with this?
here's some more.
more rubber bands there.
what're you making with the long one?
what did you make?
why don't you use the small ones?
you don't have to stretch them very far.
hmm?
mmhm.
do you know what a design is?
designs are different shapes of things.
what is that you're making?
a boat.
two motor boats.
ok.
what is that you're making?
what?
oh, two big boats.
I can't see.

a design doesn't have to be something.
it can just be a shape that you think is pretty.
I think Paul put one on.
he wants to play with you, Adam.
alright.
well, let him put one on.
that's a rubber band.
yes, can you think of anything else that that's like that?
like band and bandaid?

well, pick the rubber bands up and put them in the bag.
he thinks it's a what?
well, it is round like a ring.
no, you can't play the game if you don't play the rubber bands.

so they willn't be so stretched.
mmhm.
I'll hold it while you put yours down.
put this back first, Adam.
do you like this?
no.
oh, Paul.
no, not lobster.
they're part of rabbit.
they're part of big rabbit.
well yes, like lobsters.
but that's after the skin is off.
you, Paul.
Adam, go look on the bed and bring Paul one of your books.
I think there're some old books there that are all torn.
mmhm.
now put this back in the bag, Adam.
do you think Robin uses that?
yes, since he's a big boy and goes to school.
what kind of school do you go to?
you don't learn how to count at nursery school.
you do?
can you count?
ok.
if you can count tell me how many I have up there.
don't step on the book, honey.
these are what kind of people?
Eskimo.
would you like me to read?
I'd like to see it.
Paul would like to see it.
we need something like a shoelace to spin it.
yes.
there's one in there under your bed.
you go this way.
because it's closer.
that's just right.
now you hold onto the handle and pull as fast as you can pull.
how can you tell it's going to stop?
you're going to do it.
now hold on to the handle and pull hard.
hold back a little further.
good.
yes, you did.
yes.
what's going up in the sky?
move your hand a little farther?
no, Adam will do it this time and you may do it next time.
he couldn't do that, could you, Paul?
that's right.
you have to wrap it around first.
good.
that pretty.
yes.
that was very good.
there it is.
no, you tricked yourself.
you didn't know where it went.
like a snake?
it wobbles in like a snake?
I'll be right back.
yes.
oh, she is.
did she come to visit?
does she play with you?
I'll go upstairs later.
uhhuh.
good for you, Adam.
Adam put it on the other way, I think.
is it easier this way?
yes.
wrap the gas in?
you did?
that was very good.
is it Paul's turn?
you look sleepy.
yes, I see.
yes.
no, I don't know what a grabby boat is.
please, tell me.
a grabby boat is for shirts?
sweaters too?
will I find any blouses on the grabby boat?
any dresses?
any pants?
yes, you are.
you can count?
can you read?
no, Paul can't count either.
oh, I'm sure Robin can read.
you and Robin are friends.
oh yes, you can.
you're a big boy.
perhaps the shoelace got tangled that time.
it's your turn.
you have to show me how to do it.
how do you do it?
what do I turn around?
what do I turn around?
this?
it willn't turn.
like that?
well, what do I pull?
oh.

we'll let Paul.
why don't you let Paul do it?
alright, Paulie, we'll let Paul pull the string.
alright?
oh, Paul.
look, here it is.
poor little baby.
ok, is it Paul's turn?
why don't you turn it now so he can see it?
he likes to see it turn.

yes, you are a big boy.
you have to do what?
what happened?
you want to try this?
you don't know?

no no, let him have that one, dear.
has a what?
top and no bottom.
you need some paper first.
what can you use for paper?
no no, those are Daddy's things.
why don't you use the newspaper there on the sewing machine?
that's a magazine.
are you ready for some water?
we don't have any different colors.
no no, you put the water in here.
no, because next time you want to use the paints they would be all
there's a cow.
why don't you paint the cow?
that's pretty, Adam.
that's a pretty color.
no, why?
can drink it, what does that mean?
it makes what?
meals?
what's a meal?
yes, I think it will dry.
alright.
what'll you cook?

so how can that make it black?
that's black.
mmhm.
it's already black.
do I know what?
what tire do you see in the store?
why are you doing that?
but you just painted it.
you can't wash paint until it dries.
no, because you've taken the paint off.
the paint's all on your hands.
no no, don't put your fingers in it, Adam.
have you finished here?
well, then don't wash your hands until you've finished.
so you're all finished.
no, you said you had finished.
no no.
this is Paul's .
but you want to wash your hands.
why did you wash your hands?
would you close that door, please?
no, so that
so that we willn't hear the noise from out there.
you paint with a paint brush.
why're doing that?
that's not finger paint.
that's water color.
use your brush, honey.
yes, for painting.
no, it's not fingerpaint.
you're silly.
yes, if you put it aside and let it dry.

he's feeling better.
maybe he's hungry.
oh, you are?
don't do that.
just paint your truck now.
you just paint that.
you're cooking syrup?
what do you use that for?

why did you waste your paint?
but you painted it first.
until you wash it off.
you mean a fish net?
why not?
yes, I like swordfish.
no, I wouldn't like to catch a swordfish.
because I don't know that much about fishing.
you do?
well, how would you keep the swordfish from sticking you in the

yes.
I guess something is disturbing him.
it will dry very quickly if you just leave it there.

just like that.
yes.

can you drink two cups at once?
alright.
you can keep those.
alright.
and then I'll bring it back sometimes.
what other things would you like me to bring back that I brought
do you think that's a clock?
in case you want to ride your car on it?
I still have some water.
do you want to drink this?
alright.
why do you think it makes the bubbles?
why does it make so many bubbles?
lots of what?
spots?
you mean the water's dirty?
whoops, it's spilling over.
oh, Adam.
what're you going to do about that, Adam?
pour some in another cup.
why don't we clean up this tray?
you don't want your cup what?
you're drying the cup?
what else're you going to have?
well no, I think I better take that back and bring it again.
what?
did you ever have something called flupperc millerc?
what's it look like?
I never heard of a Flupper_nutter.
you did?
squeeze?
we better put a cup under there.
shall we pour that in there?
let's see if I can get it out this time.
yes.
can I see yours?
no, I think that's enough, Adam.
so it be a bigger what?
no.
that'll be enough.
this is hard to do.
then maybe that's enough.
how about this?
that's a new one.
I'll start it for you.
I got it started, Adam.
yes.
you need it to fly the plane.
that's right.
you do?
well, let's see.
where do the wings go?
you don't remember?
just push this down.
don't you suppose it goes like that?
Paul, he'll show you how it goes.
he'll show you how it goes like a good big brother.
big brother shows you how everything goes.
don't you, big brother?
why not?
what happens at eight thirty?
I need the directions, Adam.
Diandra, come over here.
what happens at eight thirty?
you're taking off at eight thirty?
there's not enough instructions for me.
nope.
it says do it like this.
and then you let it go like that.
one end goes here
that's the way.
oh, that's alright.
it'll dry out.
do you want to try, Adam?
well, why don't you leave it on and then well alright.
I guess that will still fly.
alright.
back up, pilot.
what?
outside.
it's not eight thirty yet?
come on, Diandra.
let's look in the basket.
alright.
tall tall tower.
I see.
please, pilot, don't run into me.
oh please, don't ride on my back, airplane.
Adam, do you know what this is?
it's not a clock really, it's a compass.
it tells you directions.
it has on numbers that tell you north east south and west.
the airplane needs to know what direction it's going in.
that's right.
especially airplanes because they don't have any roads to go on.
they have to know which way they're going.
yes then, they don't have to use the compass.
there's another one.
no no, Adam.
here, Diandra.
here's another one.
why are you going to take his, Adam?
you don't have any.
in the dark?
tonight?
what about today?
yes, dis is Ursula's day.
that's right.
is there a television on the airplane?
do you?
that's the nose.
that's where you put the rubber band.
no, those are his, Adam Smith, did you hear me?
it doesn't help to cry.
the wheels might be up in here.
they don't drop down until you're ready to land.
when it's flying in the air you don't need wheels.
where you going?
see what happens?
sure.
no, Adam had the compass, Paul.
are you going to draw an airplane?
just like yours?
alright here.
would you like a piece of her paper?
say thank you.
what're you going to draw?
airplane too?
Mommy.
how does he look when it's snow time?
thank you very kindly, Adam, that was very nice of you.
you have to ask for it.
I put mine away over here.
no, you're drawing for me, aren't you?
I thought you drew one for me.
did you go to school yesterday, Adam?
what would it look like?
how many?
here's the wing.
that's hard.
here's a star.
will you make the star?
there.
ok.
is that a hard paper?
maybe if you put it on the puzzle it would be easier, wouldn't it?
that's nice.
uhhuh.
it has a Beetle?
a bl?
did you make a tail?
how about a tail light?
how many wings?
that's a what?
why is that an octopus?
what is that, Adam?
that's a good idea.
are you the pilot?
no?
the driver sometimes is called the pilot.
I can't see them.
where are they?
oh yes, I can.
can you show which is the wing?
who's on the airplane now?
nobody?
it's in the garage?
does it have enough gas?
oh yes.
does it have a compass?
the thing inside the tire is a compass.
would this do?
what?
I've never seen him.
oh, thank you.
when is he on early in the morning?
did you see him already today?
tomorrow would be fine.
is it very early in the morning?
I might not be able to get here that early.
yes?
I live in Cambridge, remember?
you used to live in Cambridge, remember?
yes, on Trowbridge Street.
and I used to come and visit you.
do you know where you live?
yes, would you, please?
do you know how to spell it?
ul.
rl.
sl.
il.
el.
that's all.
should I write your name now?
how do you spell it?
al.
dl.
al.
ml.
there it is.
that's right.
how do you get the wheels down?
oh yes.
how do you make them go up?
isn't that nice.
what were you going to say about your Daddy?
that's nice of you.
a dog?
a dart?
oh, that's a wheel.
that's your dot maker.
Adam, which crayon is longer?
which one?
show me.
what color paper would you like?
the light blue or the dark blue?
this one?
this one?
what color is that?
that's Robin's favorite color too.
no?
what do you need?
is this what you need?
maybe this is what you need.
yes, what would you like?
shall we each have a piece?
I'll have to make a square first.
I could make a bird.
what other one?
out of this piece?
that was a sneeze.
how do you sneeze?
now do the way I sneeze.
it says I need another paper?
not yet.
I have to finish folding it first.
it's supposed to be a bird, not a tent.
you fold it to be a wing.
should we get the telephone?
no no, Daddy answered it.
you did.
well, isn't that nice?
there's your bird.
oh, is that right.
oh, it's not a very heavy airplane, is it?
I didn't even feel it.
I'm glad you do.
the tape recorder's working, and so is the doorbell?
neither one.
what was wrong with it?
but it wouldn't work?
don't you think I could sit in that chair?
I usually sit there.
do you think I could sit in it this morning?
do you think I could sit in it this morning?
what does he do?
what kind of fish?
how did you catch them?
what're you doing with the fish?
what happened to your shoe?
careful.
that looks like a piece of rug to me.
if you say so.
who wears that?
you wear it?
let's see.
oh yes.
look.
they're going to fall out, aren't they?
where's your doggie?
how big is he now?
he's growing.
which things?
that's question mark and that's a question mark.
because it's a book of riddles.
no, riddles.
what fish do what?
why are fish so smart?
see all the fish?
they're so smart because they always go around in schools.
what?
what do you think?
it says what hurts more than a giraffe with a sore throat?
a centipede with sore feet.
what do you think?
that's right.
it's a box of quackerswp.
what's he doing?
would you rather have an elephant chase you or a lion?
let's see what the next page is.
in bed?
what happened to the turtle?
let me see.
why don't you put an ad in the paper when you lost your dog?
he's crying because he lost his dog.
did he find it?
yes, certainly.
do you know what letter that is?
hl?
al, that's right.
ok.
well, it's got a line this way too.
alright.
so many!
look how many al-s you've got.
how many are there?
count them.
what is it?
do you know what that's called?
a magnet.
do you know what your name starts with?
do you know what that is?
that's right.
that's not a letter, that's a sign for dividing.
when you have lots of things and you share them with your brother
which baby?
you mean Paul?
you're going to divide things with him.
almost, but you need an ml.
and then it has three lines.
do you have a crayon?
look, an el looks like that.
there's a yellow one and a blue one.
there's a red one too.
over on this side.
what about that?
that's a long one, isn't it?
alright.
yes.
that's going to be Adam.
that's a marker when you find all those letters then you can write
you need just one more.
just put that one in in the right place.
this is the start al.
dl.
we just had an al.
where did it go?
alright.
which one?
the ml?
you've got one right there.
right nearby.
what do you use your name for?
yes, which one do you want me to draw, this one?
that one?
no, we have to find a crayon to write on there.
no, because that willn't come off but crayons do.
I didn't find a crayon, did you?
alright.
who're you going to shoot?
what?
no, but I can bring it back.
I like to bring things back because then they're surprises.
I know you do.
for what kind of pistol?
I don't know that kind.
al for book?
is that what book starts with?
do you want to know how to write Mommy?
start with this ml then you need an ol.
no, now we're writing Mommy.
we need another ml.
because that's how you spell Mommy.
yes.
oh no, you have to have more.
here's another one.
that would go here and that spells mom.
oh, I see.
do you think it really does, Adam?
well, put them all on.
that's an hl for horse.
I thought they were hl-s.
what else does she call you?
what?
what other names does she call you?
tell me one.
sometimes I call my children bunny rabbits.
does she do that?
sometimes I call my children pumpkins.
what does she call you?
do you look like an elephant?
mmhm.
sometimes I call them puppies.
sometimes I call them
Rumplestilskin.
I didn't know you were a cat.
David used to be a cat.
let's see, what else?
the Lion Heart?
monkeys.
number bits?
sometimes I call my children squirrels.
we used to call them a squeezlen.
it's in between a squirrel and a weasel.
do you think it's a real animal?
probably it would have sharp teeth.
let me see.
oh yes.
which one is that?
that's right.
that's an hl for Hercules.
how can you tell that you're strong?
what?
why don't you want her to see?
yes sir.
oh, very good.
oh.
what?
no, I don't think so.
that was Paul.
Paul, did you call Adam?
we used to call you tiger a long time ago.
did you spell your name, Adam, like it is here on the paper?
no.
what is it?
oh, you had some on the back of yours too?
he was giving it to you, Adam.
can you put it up there, Adam?
now these we have to be very careful with.
you have to be very careful with them and write only on paper.
he was giving you something, Adam, that he found.
yes, it's good to make sure you put the cover back on.
isn't this it?
here it is.
no no, this is for Adam.
this is for big boys.
what is that?
leaves?
that is very pretty.
stay on the paper, Adam.
he just wants to keep them for you.
isn't that right?
let's get back up on the paper.
the boats were what?
reeds?
reeds?
reeds.
it's a water show.
what's that, you're drawing a terrible tiger?
is that something you've seen on television, Adam?
what color is that?
both?
are they both blue?
what is it?
yes, dear.
oh, is that Felix the Cat?
what's that picture?
that's not his hand, that's his mouth, isn't it?
buy a what, Adam?
don't take it apart, Diandra.
do you have some crayons?
you could crayon in that book.
you could if you do it on the newspaper, alright?
oh, look at that.
what is that?
you can't see anymore what it is, can you?
here are some of the other kind if you want.
with what?
puzzle?
are you worried about them?
what're they going to have for the picnic?
do you have a scissors?
do you know where it is?
here's a book we could read.
shall we read that first?
a lion.
birdies.
and the monkey.
they're building a fair.
here's the parade.
in a parade.
let's see if we see the king.
where?
no.
maybe he's already there.
here he is
the house of the what?
what are these things?
what?
that's right.
the kangaroo house.
they're going to the house of the what?
the bird house, that's right.
can you find the children?
the house of the
Alexander.
Flora.
and Pom.
you could buy some
franks, right.
they're holding up the sign, who's eating one?
he's got a whole bunch of packages in his pocket.
lots of feathers.
and a bottle and some feathers.
it's a statue of a lion.
that's what he wanted.
whose house is this?
yes.
and here's Alexander.
Flora.
and Pom.
they're going deep sea diving.
they all put on diving suits.
this one's going up to the top.
what's that.
a slide, splash in the water, and look what happened to him.
they go and have little something.
look where the birds sit.
what is that do you think?
the mountains?
they're watching a puppet show.
these are puppets.
these kangaroos are in there.
that's a dragon.
what do you think?
I don't know.
who?
no, here's his face.
then they couldn't see.
now it's night time.
they have to go back.
first they go for a boat ride.
here're the boats.
oh, this side, yeah.
this is the fair and this is where they live.
that's a good idea, isn't it?
but they could walk across the bridge.
now were you going to find me a scissors?
you read that one to me if you like.
well, that's what I need the scissors for.
we can make very nice designs with it if we cut some paper to go on
we have to have scissors to cut it out.
really?
how do you know that's the kind he likes?
let's use this one.
we need a circle just that size.
a circle just that size.
thank you.
I'll trim it just a bit.
that's very nice.
yes, it's sort of an egg shape.
now, Adam, let's start, I cut this way.
you turn this.
I'll hold this down.
you turn it.
whoops, not too fast.
you can turn it over and do a different one.
yes.
lots of different things.
not too fast.
a head of a turtle?
now you can set this in different places and see what it does.
each time you move it it gets a different design.
I don't think it'll write your name but it'll make lots of different
alright, try.
what?
until this writes your name?
it might do something surprising.
let's make another piece of paper alright?
alright.
it's a little bit too big.
make it a tiny bit smaller.
you like that?
no, I'll think I'll bring it back.
let's make it a tiny bit smaller.
that's right.
now it's just exactly right.
it looks like a big flower.
yes.
another turtle?
no more?
not too fast.
you need to go slower with it.
isn't that pretty?
that's enough?
ok, wait, Adam.
that's right.
I think so.
let's try it.
it's a surprise.
not too fast, Adam, because it doesn't work.
is that a turtle?
no?
what is it?
the pen?
that's what makes it draw.
no, it just stays blue.
because it's a pen that's writing.
it could but then the machine wouldn't work.
alright.
try it.
alright.
do you want to cut?
start here.
alright.
put it on.
no, I think I'll cut it now.
yes.
just a minute.
is that your favorite?
oh, is that alright?
what happened?
oh, that's a good one, Adam.
no, just one.
shall we trim it just a little bit?
alright.
shall I draw where you cut it?
alright.
remember to go very slow when you're turning.
so you can get a turtle in the middle.
now you can change it.
silly!
I didn't think you were calling anyone silly, were you?
that's what I thought.
try it like that.
that?
that makes it wavy.
it makes it wavy like on the ocean.
alright.
alright.
it's hard to hold it, isn't it?
sure.
I could draw around it.
would that make it any easier?
and you could cut on the line.
that's good.
yes.
it's pretty good.
which way?
oh yes.
there's one more piece here.
alright.
try them all.
push it down.
ok.
right.
is that what you call slow?
that isn't slow.
alright.
I'm not ready.
whoops.
you can keep those.
just be sure you don't get it on
do it on the newspaper.
ok, Adam?
what?
press it straight down on the stamp pad.
it says six five four two zero seven.
it says the same.
you can change the numbers.
well, you have to put it back in the ink gently.
six five four one nine seven.
six five four three eight.
six five four three eight.
what do you think?
keep your fingers off.
what does that say?
which one?
seven five four two zero seven.
yes.
from all of those on the bottom.
right.
did you go to school yesterday, Adam?
no?
what did you get?
what kind of something, a present?
you don't know what you got?
you don't like it?
that's all I've got.
do you know what that is?
I bet you know.
you know how to use it.
that's good.
that's it.
maybe it needs to be a little longer for you.
for Robin.
mmhm.
I know you are.
right.
which friend?
oh, at school?
how can you have too much?
think you could jump better if I tie your shoes?
no?
I think so.
let me try.
hmm?
is it?
I can't right now.
I have to go back up to see if Paul and Diandra are alright.
to see if you and Ursula were alright.
are you finished with that?
oh, would you like to play with them?
oh, that's dry Jello.
I think maybe some little boy I know put it in.
what little boy do you think?
would it be you?
then who would it be?
no.
David or else?
could be Robin.
how could Robin do that?
he just opens up a package of Jello.
mmhm.
it's a toy clock.
oh.
don't knock on the window, Adam.
huh?
careful.
Paul is right behind you.
no no, don't push.
no no, don't push.
so you can call another fire department and say come to thirty two
we need some help.
Adam, shall I strap it on for you?
Adam, let's not play that way, Diandra, don't do it now.
you can press the button on that microphone.
see what happens.
talk, Adam.
don't pretend like that.
then he willn't try to talk if you don't talk properly.
Diandra, Paul had that.
Adam, do you want to see some of the things I brought?
you are?
a fire engine?
a fireman, oh, I see.
you have to pull it all the way down.
I think you have to look toward the light.
oh, that's nice.
let Paul see it, please.
alright, Paul, you don't have to look.
footprints?
let Paul see this one.
Diandra, Paul had that.
please, give it to him.
the box is on his arm.
I see more than four.
six.
I don't see any peanut.
moustache?
this is Rocky.
Adam, let me put it in so it's straight.
look what Alvin's on.
did you say.
Alvin.
Alvin.
oh, Rocky, I'm sorry.
now you hold it still.
that's a boy.
it looks like you're there?
what?
it looks like you're there?
what does that mean?
oh, what you see on television.
you see what?
you see two?
Paul, you want to sing Old_Mac_Donald?
yes.
Paul, stop that.
we can't hear ourselves think.
careful, don't break that.

yes.
the creature from the beanstalk.

it's to make strong muscles.
squeeze it.
let's get something to do it on.
I have paper, but you have to put something under it because it makes
Diandra, now you go into your room if you can't stop that.
we could fold this this way.
just slide it under.
you think you'll what?
you'll make a refrigerator with two holes.
yes, it cuts.
it's a sharp one.
you'd better ask your mother if it's alright.
yes, if you're careful.
an egg?
what for?
for your babies?
how many do you have?
where did you lose him?
what are you giving them for dinner?
oh, I forgot.

you must have a hard time feeding all those children.
why not?
what are the others named?
Granny?

do I want to see something?
yes.

oh, we have to use the pretty umbrella.
that's a very pretty umbrella.
what?
oh, thank you.
I didn't know an umbrella had arms.
Diandra, where's the Scotch tape?
I want.
you want what?
you said to put up my umbrella.
after what?
after Diandra's father stops working?
oh, you're his father?
that's my umbrella.
Adam says he's your father.
he's making you an umbrella.
that's my umbrella.
Adam says it's mine.
it's mine.
it's mine.
it's mine.
I had it first.
I.
you boys stop chasing each other.
oh no.
that's not good for you.
there's some over there on the floor.
I'll give him mine.
don't make him cry.
Adam's going to make you an umbrella.
there's more tape.
what are you writing, Paul?
are you writing a letter?
can I help you?
Adam almost has your umbrella ready, Diandra.
oh, he doesn't want the umbrella.
that's his piece of paper and his pen.
where're you going with that chair?
what?
what?
here's my pen.
this is my pen.
yes.
no, it's my pen.
no, dear, he has this pen.
no, it's not.
how about this?
red what?
maybe some more what?
why are you going to use all of the paper?
I think so.
yes.
Diandra has the tape.
huh.
I told you when I called you, don't say huh.
yes, maybe the tape is just playing hide and seek.
I had it first.
I.
what're you doing, Diandra?
you're playing?
I'm going to put this away.
you're taking the what?
oh, you're taping the paper so no one will tear it.
you can trap them in there?
what willn't break?
no no, Paul Smith.
pick the chair up.
yes, you did.
pick it up, Paul Smith.
pick it up.
thank you.
what're you tearing up, Adam?
yes, that's mine.
you made my umbrella.
you didn't use all her paper, did you?
she probably was going to use it for something.
Goldilocks in the big papers.
what is that?
what did you say you were?
what?
were you a pirate too?
he was a tiger?
you want one what?
let's wait for a few minutes, alright?
you willn't eat!

I should hope not.
you will!

what were you doing then?
yes.
who was it?
oh, it was.
where does he come from?
where's the real Ursula?
Adam Smith, what're you doing?
yes, what is that?
why does that have to be attached to that?
it's part of it.
alright.
tell Ursula what happened.
what toy did she leave?
and what happened to it?
all by itself?
oh, I don't think so.
tell her what happened.
I willn't bite.
what do you have in your pocket?
dirt?
you turn.
what toys?
Adam, why don't you sit down?
alright.
there're some toys right there.
what do you think it says?
to what?
let's take one.
now you do the rest.
is Smokey in a real forest?
they're bears in real forests, yes.
oh.
she left it for me.
no, I let you look at it.
no, it doesn't mean that you don't like it.
it means that you like it and like to share it.
I shared my book with you.
you don't have a knight book.
what're you doing over there?
why don't you start down here?
I was looking.
no, I'm not going to do it.
no, it has to go under on the back of the card.

you missed these.
they're saying.
Adam, please, come and visit me.

I think it's a rhinoceros.
do the what?
it's not a ball to throw.
no, it's not for you.
your busy little horse?
stop, Diandra.
your busy little bull is taking care of the dogs?
I didn't think dogs and bulls were such good friends.
that was your horse?
he doesn't know dogs and boys.
what's your horse's name?
do you think the baby whale might want some milk?
oh, was that a police whistle?
there's one right at your finger.
Paul has his.
no thank you.
oh, that's such good juice.
a syrup.
what kind of syrup?
Adam, come back in here please.
yes.
I don't have no many babies.
a funnel.
you can pour things through here into a small bottle.
no, why do you want to?
why don't we not do that today?
I know you willn't .
but why don't we not not do that today.
well, Rinny's in the bathroom.
I don't think you'd like for Rinny to bite you.
wait here, Adam, I'll get some for you, dear Diandra, will you please get out of the box.
yes.
mmhm.
alright.
spill it or pour it?
it has to drip through the funnel.
it's patient?
I think that's enough for that bottle.
where's the nipple for that bottle?
she does?
why did she swallow it?
she likes milk?
here, the funnel?
did it go down already?
come on, Paul.
hold the funnel up.
how about what?

what happened to the funnel?
you have to been looking all over for de funnel?
uhuh.

it's called a pterodactyl.
it's like a big flying dinosaur.
yes, you can take them all out if you want.
you have to start here.
no, just take the paper off the bottom and then it will come out.

oh, is that what she told you?
that's right.
hmm?
no.
that's a very long one.
long one.

I haven't seen her since she was a puppy.
I saw her when she was a puppy, but not since then.
yes.
oh yes, they can, but it doesn't hurt very much.

I like to ride on the boat.

of all the things at the carnival?
how do you know what we find at the carnival?
oh, you have some friends who know a lot.
who are those friends?
oh, I wouldn't think so.
well, why don't you let Paul play with it while you're doing that?

she means how you play with it.
what happens to the barn?
it doesn't have any batteries.

you know what time?
no.
it's eleven fifteen.
nearly.
how do you know when it's morning or afternoon?

a striped watch?
I've never seen a striped watch.
I've never seen one.
I thought you said you had one.
a what boy?
a no boy with no watch?
you made it big.
it's much bigger.
it's much smaller too!
how could it be both?
that's right.
I do.
I have two tricky boys of my own.
sure.
I like you, a tricky boy.
is it getting smaller?
you could make a mask.
you can cut two big round holes for eyes and one for the nose
then it would be a mask.
shall I draw them darker?
could I have the pencil?
that's going to be a big job.
a church?
what does your church have?
on top?
where?
on the bottom of the church?
sure, will you give it back?
I can't tell.
can you tell?
just because he's crying?
does that always mean he's bad?
yes.
I can't tell.
how can you tell?
but does he only cry when he's naughty?
doesn't he cry other times?
but is that the same as naughty?
so you can't tell.
I think you're a funny boy.
you're a funny boy.
a lobster eating?
that's a punch.
what?
yes, it is a punch.
alright.
that would be nice.
you don't want Paul to get caught?
you just punch two holes on the sides.
one there and one on the other side.
oh yes, I see one that looks like a lollipop.
you could lick it, but don't .
just pretend, right?
no.
it willn't hurt you that much.
it isn't that bad.
alright.
still see the what?
get them over to the front, that's right.
yes.

it's just jumping out.
when you want to shoot you first pull this and then pull this.

there are always some more.
yeah.
oh, did you get them all?
good for you.
shall I help you?
pull this and then this.
pull that back.
now do this.
yes.
yes, and then through one of those holes and you have a score.
yes.
let's see.
that's got a score on it.
can you read numbers?
what number is that?
this is ten.
and this is twenty five.
this is fifty.
and this is seventy five.

what?
like a snowman.
are you able to make it work?
now pull that back.
this.
squeeze it.
and now pull this one.
squeeze this all the way back.
yes.
that's it.
the lights are off.
do you think they're going to sleep?
I didn't know he could reach it.
did they go?
yes.
uhhuh.
would you like to play with this?
you need a string or a shoelace, remember?
what, the gun?
doesn't it spin for long time?
Adam, do you want to hang up the clothes line?
let me see who's taller.
Adam's taller.
oh no, you willn't want any dinner.
I'd like to sit in this chair if it's alright with you.
would you like to put up the clothesline?
maybe one end could go on the drawer.
where're you going to tie the other end?
you can tie it, go ahead.
if you can't tie it maybe Robin can tie it.
alright.
Ursula brought it for Adam to play with.
alright.
let me see if there's something you can hang in the box.
your line is slipping down.
what can you do about that?
Robin, show him.
yes, somebody started making that.
maybe you could both work on this one.
oh, here's a watch.
here, Adam.
what?
Ursula tore it.
you can really wear this.
this is hard to do.
he's in the first grade.
here, Adam, here's yours.
this is a pill box.
scrap.
what's a scrap?
a medicine?
what kind of medicine is it?
Robin, what does that sign say?
why?
what letters are those like that?
sounds serious.
looks like someone's what?
what?
dead!
three boys.
don't you see three?
no!
count the boys.
you could give me a shot.
ow.
here's some medicine.
oh, what is that?
what is it?
bend it.
not bullets.
it shoots medicine.
or vaccines.
yes.
mmhm.
and you have to put it around her head.
too heavy?
yes.
Diandra, here's your book, dear.
see, Robin can read.
when you start going to school you can read too.
oh, that's for the doctor.
here, Adam, here's the cap.
alright.
what do you think that is?
what is this do you think?
you're going to give me a shot.
would you come here and be fitted, Adam?
look in the mirror, Adam.
you can't see it?
Robin told you.
operating room.
maybe you could hang it on the line.
are you going to operate?
waiting?
oh, what does the sign say?
did you tell Robin that you went to his house?
and you saw some toys of his.
you saw his tricycle.
what else did you see?
why three children?
two bikes?
oh, you mean big bicycles.
Adam, you're right.
there were three.
no, she has only has two children.
three bikes, but two children.
and we have three children and two bikes.
that's right.
it's so hard.
Adam, did you go to school this morning?
yes.
we see Underdog.
what?
I think so.
I think that's the bottom of the pill box.
Mommy.
that's a horse.
oh.
oh yes, what is that?
you have to pin it on.
there are some holes.
could I have another page?
I thought you said you could read it.
oh, you have too much work to do?
oh, that's good.
oh, how nice.
but I think you should give some to Ursula.
you think there's a what?
oh, I'm sorry.
a vase, oh.
yes, I heard you, thank you.
you're going to talk to me?
well, maybe you should stay away so you willn't trip.
well, you should stay away.
oh, Adam, why don't you give them to Robin and then he can give
then both mothers will have flowers, right?
well, you gave them to me.
and then I gave them back to you.
now you can give them to Robin and he can give them to his mother
I'll give them back now Adam.
where's the box?
that's not a box.
it's supposed to be a case.
what?
well then, I guess the nurses would have to take care of people.
then maybe each person would have to take care of himself.
alright.
don't take his things, Adam.
here you are, Adam.
you can't even what?
they're cotton balls.
for cleaning things.
if you have a hurt or scratch or cut you can clean it with a ball of cotton.
Diandra, why are you tearing it up?
that's right.
what time is it, Adam?
oh dear.
maybe you should keep the things we want to keep away from there.
Diandra, no.
you're tearing up too much.
that wouldn't be nice to do.
would you like for me to leave you down here without any dinner?
that's another pill box.
it's a little tiny pill.
Diandra, no more, dear.
you're just tearing up too much paper.
oh, did he say what I said?
it's a pill box.
yes.
no?
give you out?
what does that mean?
oh, I should give you out and that means spank you?
you're giving me a shot to make me feel better?
ah.
what's wrong, doctor?
no, he thinks you're checking him too.
the things you need that the doctor uses.
it's a supply cabinet, isn't it?
I don't think you put the medicine in there.
I think you put the tongue depressor in there and other things like
I don't think so.
that's for taking medicine.
no, liquid medicine.
do you have a bottle of medicine?
you need to do what?
rash?
what kind of rash?
oh, I see you put some medicine on my hand and washed it off?
he's taking a rash off my hand.
that's cotton on the end of a stick for pretending to clean your
is it real?
no.
is that a sick doggie?
close the door, please.
no, all the way.
so we can hear better.
what?
on what, dear?
I don't think that's a pill, is it?
I'm trying to fix it.
I think we need a little bit of Scotch tape.
I don't think so.
Adam, don't sit on that.
it's not.
oh, did the baby cry?
she's not a crybaby?
can you try it yourself?
shorter than I am?
Adam, do you want to see the film that Ursula took the other day?
do you want to see a cartoon?
would you like to look in this box, Adam?
you look like you're excited.
they call it a film viewer or film editor.
you look like you're excited.
they call it a film viewer or film editor.
viewer?
can you wind that?
I know you are.
will that cord reach?
do you want me to plug it in?
how does this work?
that's the handle to turn the film.
do you?
there we are.
this one is a Popeye film.
alright.
where're you going?
not yet.
maybe we can close the curtains.
if the room is dark we can see it better.
that looks like for what?
oh, for boys and kids.
I think that was Abbott and Costello.
we'll have to take the film off to have an empty reel.
I think we'll just do it to this one.
who's crying?
is it Diandra or Paul?
do you know all about this?
yes.
well, you can see it right here at home.
once we get it on she can see it.
there's a button on the side that turns the light on.
you are not, are you?
this is a little bit tricky.
yes, it is.
now we're getting there.
do you have a bad cold, Adam?
turn this light on on the side.
push it forward.
alright.
you eat spinach too?
yes.
there we go.
there's the Popeye movie.
there's a lady with lots of children.
oh, she has a lot of children.
how many does she have?
eight!
eight children!
are they boys or girls?
all boys?
my goodness.
do you want to see where they bump their heads?
they both are bowing before her and they bumped their heads.
they're both pulling her.
she's going to break in half.
looks like it.
what did he do?
I think you're right.
want ta see them run backwards?
alright.
what's happening now?
look, she's stuck on a tree.
poor Olive, she's tied in a knot.
Adam, you can rewind that one, alright.
yes, go all the way backwards, that's right.
let's see what we find in this one.
these will be pictures of Robin and David and their friends and
I wouldn't think so.
do you want to turn the button on, Adam?
this is a halloween parade.
there's somebody in a white shirt.
who does that look like?
doesn't it?
Adam's not interested in this.
there's something recognizable.
alright, we'll go back to cartoons, alright?
do you want to see Popeye?
Adam, would you like to do the turning?
well, why don't you do it?
you want to see it.
this is going to be Popeye.
two?
no, you turn it for me.
let me see it.
what happened?
that many?
oh no.
I'd probably forget their names.
is he going to buy a ring?
with what on her nose?
oh.
what happened?
how do you think you have to do it?
oh, I want to see it.
oh, you got to the end.
you never heard of what?
oh, I've seen some.
I have one more comedy if you want one.
why is it dangerous?
does it go in this box?
yes, this is Popeye.
that's alright it is, Adam.
no, wait, don't do that.
would you like one more?
we can do that one we unwound.
yes.
wait, no, don't pull it, Adam.
you'll break it.
I'm not sure, Adam.
where is that?
oh yes.
yes, I'm your mother too.
I'm not quite sure.
no, wait, wait.
why would you do that?
out out out.
no no.
we have to leave it down in the box.
alright?
alright, Adam.
you may wind some more.
ok.
can you stop now and look at the picture?
what's that doing?
did they fall off yet?
hold still.
stop.
we have to straighten the film.
who was scared?
oh, the man on the building.
you're not scared of anything?
goodness, you're a brave little boy.
that you're not afraid.
what animals?
you're afraid of a starfish?
they're animals, I guess.
yes, they're real.
alright, would you like to turn more?
ok.
hold still.
stop, stop, stop.
what're you doing with my box?
that's the what?
don't you think it might be a little too large to go on there?
oh, you're ready for some more film.
they fall off yet?
you told your skin to stop.
no no, let me do it.
you may break it, dear.
alright.
oops.
what happened?
wait.
alright.
I guess he wants to go on there too.
thank you.
alright, Adam.
can you turn it off?
what is it a picture of?
because I like to sit there.
alright.
can you unplug it, Adam?
I'm sorry.
no no, you have to turn it off and then unplug it.
because when you turn it off you cut the current off and then you
it could.
not when it's off.
that's a very nice boy, Adam.
like this.
it's already down.
that's a very nice neat boy, Adam Smith.
are you sleepy, Adam?
what color is that?
what color is that?
what color is that?
are those two red?
with only one stripe?
is Robin going to have a turn?
what?
any way you wish, dear.
I don't think I'd like either one, thank you.
I don't think that's exactly right.
thank you, that's exactly right.
the other children are asleep?
oh, a strike.
how many did you knock down?
well, that was fast.
maybe you'd like to build with Robin.
here's the ball.
where's the other bowling ball?
oh yes, you can.
it's hard.
oh yes.
just blow very hard.
I think you could blow it, Adam.
oh no, I'm sure that's not hard to do at all, dear.
try it.
no, I can't .
just like you blew up the duck.
you watch and see how Robin does it.
there it comes, see?
there it is.
it will take time, it has to grow.
alright.
it looks like an oldfashioned light bulb.
smoking a peace pipe.
that's right.
but you're losing too much air.
try to get the air down through the hole.
you blow and let me go get Paul and Diandra.
now it looks like a street light.
what do you think it looks like?
yours looks like a dirigible, the kind of balloon people used to
is it made of marble?
no, probably something like rubber.
no, it's just very big.
bigger than this room.
yes, that balloon is strong.
do you want to make a little bigger?
enough?
I'm going to take a little air out of mine.
how did he do it?
I don't think that's how.
try it.
I think you could.
it's easier the second time.
keep your mouth tight around the pipe.
this long stem.
what do you call it?
no.
it's plastic.
what do you think the balloon is made of?
made of what?
I think they get it inside of certain trees in South America.
rubber.
to make tires and balloons and rubber bands.
no, they're rubber.
what?
you could play it with Robin.
how do you play it?
if you see what?
you just made that up.
stamps?
no, he means paper clips.
paper clips.
those are made out of metal.
no, balloons are made out of rubber.
are made out of wood.
and what does wood come from?
uhhuh.
metal comes from under the ground.
under the ground.
if you have a quarter you can change it into two dimes.
how do you think they make dollars?
out of paper.
they draw on it.
paint on it.
can't draw what?
Pete?
I don't know.
a name.
of somebody.
I don't know.
I know a boy named Peter, is that what you mean?
did you have a different Adam at school today?
you told me about one last time.
no?
never?
sure.
that's Robin.
you tell him where.
it has to be in this room though.
well, you have to hide.
did he find you or somebody else?
how come Rinny's so quiet?
ok.
Robin's .
Robin, give Diandra his balloon.
what, Adam?
do you remember where you played with them?
where the what?
mmhm.
mmhm.
the doorway.
no, what?
Adam, could you show us where's the bathroom?
don't go in the bathroom, dear if somebody's in it.
that looks pretty, Adam.
the road?
that's a building block to the house.
that can go wherever you want.
it does.
I think we willn't open that yet.
maybe next time.
no, I think we have enough things out for now.
yes.
mmhm.
an umbrella?
a pair of glasses?
clock?
a fishing rod?
get off what?
did you say.
get off, I'm at the farm.
oh, isn't that nice.
that's a long one, Adam.
long fishing rod.
what did Robin make, Adam?
is that a horse or a dog?
a dog.
Robin, how's your kitty?
good.
it gets into lots of trouble.
do you know what that kitty does when I clean house?
whenever I'm sweeping the kitty lands right in the dirt.
right now?
the kitty's home sleeping.
she's waiting for everyone to come home, Adam.
she goes to sleep all day while we're not there.
she doesn't want to be tired when they do get home.
what kind of fish are you going to get?
what kind of fish is that?
ask him.
no.
mmhm.
the car that I have now.
I think that's marvelous.
it means I think it's very very very nice.
did you know her father is Robin's grandfather?
yes.
I'm getting all wet.
why, Adam?
pretty soon but not yet.
you can hardly wait.
yes, now you can.
Adam, for that we need a tray.
let's do it right over here, Adam.
I know we need a little saucer or dish to pour some in.
I'm not sure it's wide enough.
she's coming back.
he doesn't what?
he doesn't want me to take care of him?
you, oh.
oh, I don't think they would, though, would they?
let me have the cover back.
let me have the cover.
turn this upside down, dip it in and then blow.
do it very flat so it touches all the way around.
blow again. you have to blow out and then take it out of your mouth and breathe.
may I do one?
blow through it.
you're finished with it.
already?
yes, it seems a little too quick.
well, Adam.
if you're finished with it you better pour it back into the jar.
are you really ready?
blow, Adam.
try it again.
do you think those are pretty?
that's right.
good.
let's give Paul another try.
I know but it's sticky.
mmhm.
want me to help you with it?
now if you open it you have to play with it.
you can't just open it and look at it and say.
I'm all finished.
who's hungry?
well, you have to ask her first.
yes, and maybe you can share them with other people.
why don't you close the box and put the box up because you can't eat
you can only have two.
you may give Paul and Diandra another one.
no, one for Paul and one for Diandra and then put them up.
alright.
well, close the box and put the box back in.
Diandra.
put the box back in the bag.
no, he willn't spill them.
wait, Adam, don't break it now.
let's see what happens.
it's on plus.
that means it's going to add.
you're going to add the numbers together?
no, that's not right.
what are those numbers?
don't leave them spread out over the floor, the little boys might
alright.
get over on the floor.
your favorite what?
you just took them out.
no no, Adam, now that's not the way you got them.
pick that up.
yes, it is very easy to pick up.
that's why there should be none of it left.
there it is, under the chair.
I don't see how you could be finished so soon.
see if there's a pad of paper in my bag.
Adam Smith.
alright.
maybe there isn't one.
you can use this.
what did you say?
I don't know.
oh, I'm sorry.
oh, that means marvelous.
marvelous means that?
you did.
what did you dream?
no, Diandra, you're not to play with the crayons. maybe you could draw something, Adam.
do you suppose you could draw some flowers?
spring flowers?
oh, it's very nice.
I think I put them up on the mantle there.
yes, I heard about that.
first grade, just like Robin is in.
what?
no, but he's in the first grade in a different school.
oh, that's not nice to say.
what does feather brain mean?
oh.
because Indians have feathers around their brains?
hello, you didn't have enough rest today, did you?
you didn't have enough of a nap.
is that what happened?
oh?
well, you should not have watched it.
why don't you use that other paper on the back for a stem.
oh, what did you write?
could you read it to me?
oh, marvelous.
I'm sorry.
yes, I did forget.
oh, what is that?
give it to Adam.
no no, that's Adam's .
what?
what're you going to do?
no, Diandra, that's his flower.
what?
the wizzyc lion, I don't know what that is.
who is that?
the line?
the what?
oh, Reggie.
oh, did you draw the stem on that one?
can you say thank you?
thank you.
what color do you think he should color it?
alright.
he said you may color it.
what is your favorite color?
what color is that?
oh, Adam.
you're welcome.
Adam, you knocked your crayons across the floor.
that is pretty.
Diandra, do you want to take a breath?
no.
you didn't draw a stem.
why don't you cut a stem?
here's a piece of paper.
use the side of this for a stem.
what will she have to write on?
didn't I bring some paper home to you?
what do you want?
what?
well, give that to me and I'll give that to Paul.
be quiet now.
draw on your paper.
that's nice.
what did you say, Adam?
is this yours?
is this yours?
oh, I'm sorry.
Mommy.
Mommy.
how?
how?
how what?
how would you what, Adam?
what's freesofc?
what's freesofc?
oh, Adam, he has to be saying something.
Diandra, you just color for a few minutes.
Mommy.
Mommy.
what're you making, Adam?
what happens when we go to sleep?
are you going to give me a lesson in making flowers?
what is that, Adam?
look under your paper.
are you sitting on them?
car.
cars, yes.
car truck.
car truck.
that's a nice color.
that's hard, isn't it?
oh, isn't this nice, Adam.
where can I find a piece of scissors?
will you two please stop?
what a nice lot of flowers you've got.
truck.
do you have a long stem on there?
how would that help?
no, I think you do.
Diandra, no no.
get away from the tape recorder, dear before you knock it over.
that's right.
I don't understand how she understands anything anyway.
I think perhaps we're going to have to take Paul and Diandra outside
Adam, these are really very nice flowers.
how many cars do you have?
sneezy.
how could your hair get sneezy?
do you make flowers like that at school?
that lady that sleepedn
maybe that's a babysitter who went to sleep.
oh, she stayed when I was sick.
you could see what else is in the bag.
there's one other thing.
under your sweater.
remember we made these beautiful flowers?
it's a worm?
what is, Adam?
are you finished?
here.
let's do it on top of the newspaper.
how?
yes, because it's inky.
remember to put de cover on.
because it get dry.
that's very pretty.
yes.
what do you think?
hmm?
baseball?
put the cover back on, Adam.
what kind of color is that?
what do you think?
it has a tip.
mmhm.
what are you writing?
put the cover back on.
twist it.
may I try?
here, Adam.
I'm afraid I don't have any juice but you may have a banana.
you may give Robin a banana and Ursula a banana if you like to.
yes.
what?
what?
I forgot to say that you could have a banana?
I didn't .
I said, Adam, you could have a banana and offer Robin and Ursula one
don't forget the cover, Adam over under the chair.
not very well.
Robin, would you give him a few pieces of paper.
sure.
in case you want to carry it with you.
you didn't put the top back on the yellow.
you hold this down.
take a test.
what kind of test?
oh.
will you make a picture of me too?
alright.
you'd love to be a banana monkey?
what?
do you want to use another color?
don't forget the top.
look.
it's behind the crayons.
here's the red.
I'll blast it off for you.
what happened?
is that the baby fish.
what's your favorite color?
a spider.
a rainbow.
is it?
a snail.
a shell.
it is?
you find shells in the bottom of the sea.
you could.
you don't want a fish what?
you could wear a suit to cover you all up.
to go under the water.
that's what divers do.
I saw a movie about it.
about men who lived under the sea for three months.
how could they?
they didn't have enough air.
they took their air along with them in tanks, they made their own
they went down and explored the bottom.
I could show you some pictures of that movie.
ok.
alright.
Robin, would you give him some more?
do you want me to do it?
Adam, let's take off one cover at a time, alright?
no, one at a time.
is that the air tank?
they're all covered in suits.
so they don't get wet and they have a plastic thing so even the
it's round and you can see through it like a
like a helmet but it covers the face so you wouldn't get wet.
no.
for going under water, it doesn't have holes in it so you don't get
you're making him all wet.
good.
here's a color.
what's base?
oh.
something like gloves.
something like boots but like a suit that covers him everywhere.
they're already here.
yes.
they're up there by my purse.
good for you, for putting all the tops on, Adam.
my, you're hungry.
I might just save mine.
mmhm.
I'm not hungry just now.
are you?
really?
can you make some fish under the water?
here it is, right under your knee.
it's still under your knee.
try again.
is that a test.
that's not a test.
you can take that out to play with.
you can surprise your Mother.
she willn't know what's in there.
would you like some more banana, Adam?
open it up and take half.
I'll show you how much is half.
I don't think so.
you really think so.
let's see what else is in my bag.
you want to look at the little book.
no, didn't you see them before?
are you going to finish making yours?
alright.
who's the teacher?
do you know you can bend that mirror?
how do you look bent?
don't you like the mirror?
let me see if it needs cleaning.
it does.
three legs?
no, I'm just using a handkerchief.
oh, isn't that pretty.
what is that?
is it an apple?
is it something you eat?
is it a hat?
do I know anything like it?
alright.
I give up.
isn't that pretty.
oh.
isn't it nice.
I don't like myself very much.
how do you like yourself?
is there green?
how did you open it when I wasn't in here?
Mrs Ursula opened it?
Mr, come on, Adam.
Diandra, see yourself in there?
write a story for us.
Adam, why don't you write your name.
you're not a little what?
she'll be surprised.
do you want to use the newspaper?
I've never seen your name written like that.
where's the al?
I only see your name one time.
all the other times your name is all wrong.
Adam, put your paper on the newspaper.
just use one piece at a time.
and you didn't tear it off properly.
Mommy.
Mommy.
where are you going?
then you'll be here all by yourself.
would you give him a little piece?
that not David.
that Robin.
what're you making, Adam?
have you finished with this one?
oh no, not yet.
I didn't have enough boxes.
it's a dollar, sing.
Adam, what're you making?
could you give us a piece of paper, please?
it could be the result of a fire but
keep coloring on the back.
that's very nice.
that very nice.
did Robin make that?
why not?
oh, is that Adam's name?
let's bring everything over here.
what happened to all the crayons?
invisible!
I don't think so.
and I'll take Paul and Diandra.
we talked about it and you said that Mommy could go.
I'll be back shortly.
leave Paul here?
well, Paul will probably cry and then Ursula couldn't hear the tape
alright, Paul, here's one for you.
Adam, you want to first look here to see all the different kinds of
no, that's the top.
that's the part.
these are the things that you build with, see, because they rest on
no no.
Adamy, don't do that.
they aren't swords.
what?
let's see you build it.
it seems to me you place these long ones on top of one another.
Paul, we might have to go upstairs, hmm?
what's this?
those are building blocks.
well, this is Paul's .
he wants to build.
they look like beds.
there are no written directions.
there's just building there.
and you can make your building just like it by just looking at it.
you don't have what?
please, let him have some, dear.
Adam, let him have some, please.
look behind you, Diandra.
I think I better take you out.
can you build something on there, Adam?
there's something started.
can you find another piece like this, Adam?
are there any more big ones?
let him have some of the little ones, Adam.
you can have some too.
you use these.
put some little ones in between and then it stays better.
yes, now you can put another long piece on.
yes.
careful it doesn't fall down.
now you do the other side.
why is it naughty?
he can take some.
no, he's not.
looks like a what?
that's a rooftop.
here, Diandra.
let's give him a few more.
let's see if we can't make it stand up.
I guess that one's too small, let's put a bigger one on.
did you go to school today?
with who?
you want to put that one on?
what's the matter?
your shoe is untied?
good and then you can put a roof on.
oh yes.
what're you doing?
that looks high enough, Adam.
are they both the same so you can put a roof on?
I think this needs to be one higher.
no, Diandra, you use those.
carefully.
very carefully.
what're you going to do with them.
maybe you could make a floor.
look at your building and see.
oh, we should make some steps.
that's a good idea.
it wouldn't be so hard to make steps.
what?
oh yes.
you could have an open house and walk in.
then you don't need doors and windows but you do need steps.
I don't think so.
now where we live.
what?
maybe this house is way out in the country.
are you going to have any furniture in the house?
furniture.
who is going to sleep in the beds.
me!
I'm too big.
alright.
Adam, do you know what he's saying?
not higher than the roof?
how could you sleep higher than the roof?
I thought we're pretending I'm small.
it's a bunk bed.
is everything alright?
I'm going upstairs because Paul really is very cranky this afternoon
you didn't make a gate.
a fence.
you need two straight pieces.
and a lot of little pieces.
I think they have to be the double kind.
the fat kind.
like that.
that's a good idea.
we'll do that next.
right on top.
oh, that looks good.
shall we make a fence all around the house?
ok.
now you'll be safe.
why don't move that over because that might not go over the.
the fence?
thank you.
isn't that a pretty fence?
mmhm.
ok.
we'll fix that, Adam, that's not too hard to fix.
not too hard.
here.
a mouse!
a mouse can't eat me.
I'll eat the mouse.
it is not.
did you see any pictures of the circus.
have you been to the circus?
now we need one more side.
oh, that's so pretty, Adam.
now you could fix up the house again and put the roof on.
it doesn't need a floor.
does it need a roof?
maybe it doesn't .
yes, that's right and that could be the water.
you can pretend.
make another one and we'll have a race.
alright.
the boat knocked down a house.
let's put everything back first.
will you help Diandra?
I didn't bring the top.
I have my car just outside.
it doesn't take very long to get from here to the car.
yes, it does.
it takes very long from Harvard.
that's where you used to live.
I live near there.
I'm in the same place.
is that yours?
does Diandra have one too?
apple, Mommy.
did you finish yours already?
are they all picked up?
alright.
then maybe Diandra can play with it next.
why don't you let Diandra play with the windmill and we'll put this
Diandra's your mother!
alright.
be very careful.
submarine?
bless you.
it should.
it's supposed to.
alright.
maybe it's a jet.
yes.
yes.
no.
but this is peace time.
peace time means there's no war.
yes.
make it go high.
let's see if there's something else to do on it.
good for you, Diandra.
this makes it fly straight, I think.
oh, that's good.
it made a loop.
oh yes.
I see.
what's that, Paul?
no, let him look at it.
it says.
all controls.
I don't think there is one.
oh yes.
I don't think so.
Adam, close the door, please.
thank you, Adam.
no, Diandra.
seems you haven't finished playing with that.
well, put it back in the bag.
no, in the bag where you got it.
it wasn't in the basket.
yes.
you could draw on it.
alright.
you look in there and I'll look in here.
I don't know what's in that bag, Adam.
what is it?
some what?
some what things?
is there anything else in that bag?
let's sort them out.
looks like a corkscrew, doesn't it?
I had some spaghetti like a corkscrew.
yes.
this kind.
and then I had some
I'll see if I can make the shape.
I had some like this.
did you ever have that?
cereals?
you mean Rocky and Bullwinkle have them?
no.
you mean Rocky the squirrel?
you mean Rocky?
I don't see television very often so I guess I don't know.
yes, I can.
I just don't know about Rocky.
let's see, what shall we make?
can you?
shall I make one for you?
what's that?
is that your brother?
which finger do you want it on?
is it too tight?
do you want me to fix it?
it is too tight.
how about this way?
oh, what's that?
let's put up a block so it doesn't go too far.
I don't know where.
it looks like he's heading for the chair leg.
do you want a ring for your other hand?
will you make me a ring?
that's the right way.
no, I don't .
an airplane?
a balloon?
a lasso.
because you gave me a hint.
here, see if this fits your other finger.
ouch.
ouch.
I'm not used to sitting on the floor.
do you want more?
like Ringo.
you know who Ringo is?
one of the Beatles.
make a what kind of spear?
mmhm.
what else shall I make?
another ring?
really?
my car is broken.
how come you know I didn't bring my car?
did you look out the window and see that it isn't there?
my car doesn't work anymore.
it willn't start at all.
what?
shall I?
what color?
that would be pretty.
do you want another one?
I could make one for every finger if you want.
one more?
oh, one for me.
were you at school?
of course?
who's Kris?
is she a special friend?
I guess I made it too small.
that's very nice, Adam.
that's a beautiful bow.
look at those colors.
here's your bow.
I don't think I do, do you?
a bigger one, no, I don't .
how?
what's the difference between a spear and an arrow?
what about the arrow?
that's a very funny thing.
you could hang it from the ceiling.
shall I make you a necklace?
a gun.
I certainly don't .
that's a bicycle.
a big truck.
me too.
sounds like a motorscooter to me.
what would a lion be doing on your street?
I would care.
I wouldn't mind if a monkey wakes me up.
if a what?
car?
oh.
yes, I don't like a clock to wake me up but I don't mind monkeys
does your puppy wake you up?
you would.
I'll take them off.
we can make some flowers.
in your yard?
did you plant them?
can I see them from here?
I'll see them when I go out.
no, not like this one.
I just made this one up.
you want to make some too?
oh, is that yours?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to take that.
do you go to school all day?
in the morning too?
I thought maybe you go in the morning and stay and have lunch there.
is that how it goes?
does Kris go home too?
it's a funny flower.
isn't it?
here's another one.
what happened to my flowers?
oh no, she's here.
she's upstairs talking to somebody.
must be a gun.
me too.
oh yes.
then we have to make a sprinkling can.
oh yes, I can.
alright.
let's see first how big your wrist is.
here's one.
no.
well, I can make
no.
no, I can make a hammer and a chair.
wait a minute.
I have to put this on you.
let's try.
you have to ask me when you want it off.
you're just going to keep it on?
alright.
here's your watch.
now it can't pinch you.
what time is it?
eight thirty.
that's it right there.
aren't you going to keep them on?
I'm going to keep mine on.
it comes off.
you look very elegant.
let's put them away.
I'm going to keep my ring on too.
let's leave the flowers up, alright?
are there some books in there?
do you want to look at them?
what're you going to do with the pajamas?
what does it look like?
a banjo!
let's see where it's going to fit.
doesn't your mother have one of these?
guess.
no.
guess again.
I guess this is going to fit here.
try again.
we're going to need some crackers and a bowl.
do you want to ask your mother for that?
a small bowl.
a small bowl.
let's put the crackers on here and the bowl goes here.
put a cracker in here and turn it and see what happens.
what did it make?
it's a grinder.
it grinds them up.
lots of what?
you can watch it come out here.
cracker crumbs.
you could put them back through again.
a what?
a grain thrower?
yes or else you could ask your Mother if there is anything else
it comes out like a waterfall.
I think maybe that's the last time.
watch your fingers.
what did you say, sugar?
yes, that's the one.
sure, and sheep too.
go slow.
grain fall?
I think maybe that's enough.
they do.
they taste salty and delicious.
brush yourself off.
let's see if we can rescue some of this, alright?
that means you can grind this up again.
that's a good idea.
we'll just pick it up with the paper.
look inside and see how you think it works.
where does it push it?
what way?
where does the grain go when you push it?
and then?
mm.
you could make some bread with that.
you make bread out of grain.
oh, let's take a bigger piece.
no.
careful.
you forgot something.
it'll taste like roast beef.
mm, chicken.
what does yours taste like?
chocolate!
let's make a little funnel.
pour it right in.
cheese.
grapes.
careful.
watch.
well, look what happens here.
what do you think this does when you put a cracker through there?
what do you think it does here?
how come it gets so small?
what do you think it will be like?
orange juice.
wait, Adam.
now don't forget to put the bowl back.
frost.
what's it like?
there isn't any.
stand up and we'll clean it all off again.
alright, but first I have to get it all collected.
wait for me.
don't go without me.
it's all gone.
alright.
water.
mine tastes like Pepsi_Cola.
raspberries.
it changes grain into anything you want, right?
can you make me some strawberries?
why do you have to wait till it gets older?
what kind of things do you eat that are older?
water's older?
that's right.
only it gets less every time.
oh, that's alright.
you can
we can use the flower.
who's coming down?
with the what?
what did you call it?
the grain what?
alright.
well, let's leave it up, alright?
I don't know if I have anything else.
maybe you'll have to show me some things, alright?
what do you think?
you better put those back.
the pajamas aren't to play with.
guess.
what do you think?
maybe.
I do.
cherries.
maybe I could have a drink but I can't stay for supper.
no.
why not?
we forgot to show your Mother the rings.
yes.
alright.
well, I'll take one and you take two, how's that?
what did we forget?
oh.
yes.
shall I get out the pipe cleaners?
yes.
it would grind the stick up.
yeah, but then you couldn't eat the grain anymore.
that's right, because it'll be mixed with stick.
a telescope, hmm?
I'll try.
no, thank you.
that's a good idea.
you make a chain.
a chain of flowers.
yes, it's very oldfashioned.
oldfashioned glasses?
shall we do that after the telescope?
why don't you bake some bread?
here's your telescope.
here, Diandra.
yes.
I'm making them.
oh, thank you.
I'm sorry.
that I didn't bring you down anything to eat.
well, we had all those fruits, strawberries and cherries
oh my goodness.
now I don't have to get any birthday presents.
you do?
what time is it?
oh yes, what shall I do with it?
oh, it's good.
no, thank you.
if you want to but I don't want any more.
what do you think that was?
maybe it was a police car.
how do you know how cows eat?
how do you know how cows eat?
no, thank you.
say no, thank you.
Adam.
just a minute.
where shall we put this?
you had something to eat.
did you tell her what you had in there?
buds?
oh, it's a rosebud, I guess.
yes.
would he be taller than you if you trade chairs?
just a minute.
alright.
would you like to bring your chair over here?
have you told her that you're graduating from nursery school?
his robe.
who made the hats?
oh, I didn't even know I was supposed to make your hat.
out of cardboard.
well, I saw them in her office when I took the robe in.
let's take the biggest thing first.
oh, is that the way you know that's rubber?
that was very nice of you, Adam.
I wouldn't be so sure.
let me open it.
is there a trick to opening this?
good.
try it on paper.
does it work?
it's the stamp pad.
we may have to put another drop of ink on there.
maybe a drop of water would do.
just one drop, Adam.
what?
one fillc?
you don't need much, do you?
it willn't work if you put too much on there.
one more drop.
what is that?
maybe we have to use paint.
it's too wet, isn't it?
that must be paper to print on.
you can see the outline of it.
you could print it right in the book.
yes, it is, isn't it?
yes, you can even take them apart and print them.
one what?
are those letters or numbers?
can you spell your name?
Diandra, he asked you not to touch them.
stop draw.
stop draw?
alright, draw stop.
your name is draw.
Diandra, don't say stupid.
that's not nice to say.
he said what?
well, what does that mean?
I didn't hear you say thank you.
a monster magnet.
it does, doesn't it?
why do you think it sticks?
it's the most what?
oh, it's glue.
is that why it's sticking?
it's not a magnet after all?
it's not?
it's not coming out?
I don't think it really needs water.
it probably needs a little more ink in the pan.
no no, this probably needs some more ink.
pen ink.
stamp ink.
that's not really ink.
that's the water, that's mixed in with ink.
no, I don't think you need water, dear.
on the pad, yes.
Adam, why don't you let them play with it?
come on, boys, let's go upstairs.
I don't want a cat.
I've got a dog.
I don't want to have a dog.
my dog is outside.
these are Mexican jumping beans.
he can help too.
it's right underneath the ink.
no, I guess not.
isn't that nice, Adam.
very good, Adam.
can you tie your shoes?
look in the bag.
I can feel mine jump when I hold mine in my hand.
what?
yes, I see.
without what?
my arm is too big.
let me put it on you.
how can you get out?
some more?
you haven't finished playing with these.
are you sure you want something else?
alright.
what did you find, Adam?
now, Adam, you better find yourself a a target.
you could use this for a target.
it's a dart.
aim for the target.
dart.
somebody what?
you missed.
I never what?
willn't get it.
be careful.
I have an idea what you said.
I willn't tell you.
it's a secret.
you missed the target.
no.
you almost got it.
what're you doing that for?
are you his admirer?
why don't you take that one out?
you only had two.
here it is, on the chair.
is that it on the chair?
what?
shoot at yourself?
I wouldn't do that.
that could be dangerous.
no, don't point it toward anyone.
why don't you do it over here?
hit on the black.
almost.
two more darts.
well no.
let's look at your gun.
careful, Adam.
yes.
alright.
important to who?
why don't you stick to one thing?
only the one thing, yes.
that's right.
she wants so much toys.
what will I play with when I go home?
alright.
you have to take care of what?
to do what?
stand up.
what're you supposed to be?
well, let's let Paul keep one.
do you have one, Diandra?
yes.
just like a target shall be?
is that what you said?
you're aiming some place?
a Mexican day.
yes, he can keep it.
that's right.
what?
what's wrong, Paul?
why?
a what?
no, what could you put the cans on?
a record_phonec?
you mean the record player?
maybe I can help you fasten it.
I don't think so.
no, just on the door.
no, dear, on the door.
it's easier for Mommy to keep up with the door.
let's have the door for the special place for the darts.
that's the what?
who makes the rodgerc gun?
you only call it what?
a rodgerc gun.
I don't feel like reaching way up there.
am I that tall?
am I that tall?
Mommy.
Mommy.
uhhuh.
see?
are you going to be tall enough?
promise not to do it again?
I still can't reach it.
I'm afraid that willn't be sufficient.
did it?
good.
it's not up there by glue.
no.
she said no just like I said no.
no.
it works like a plunger.
no, it's not a magnet.
why do you think it sticks?
that's not the reason.
see if you can find out why.
it's not glue.
it has air.
I surely don't .
what do you think happens when I push down?
yes, just like a plunger, that's right.
when you push down it pushes out the air underneath there.
maybe he could keep two.
can you tell me what makes that stick?
I don't talk to you like that.
it wouldn't stick, would it?
why?
the what?
the dodge?
what is the dodge?
just a minute ago you were saying it was some other kind of a gun
I don't know that I've heard of anybody with Rodger as a last name.
you didn't hit her?
are you sure?
what?
that's his nursery school teacher.
how many do you have?
get on the other side, honey.
you get on this side, Diandra.
close the door, Diandra.
a mule.
that's what the expression is.
it's something you say to
yes, you say it to a person to help explain something or add color
you could shoot at anything that's set up for a target.
oh, is that why you missed?
alright, now.
again.
again.
just right.
thank you.
don't play what yet?
you say no?
why not?
why not?
yes.
I'm going upstairs and check on Paul.
ok, now you can play it.
Adam, you're in kindergarten now, aren't you?
will you sit down over here, Adam?
pretty nice, isn't it?
ok, you want to surprise her?
where's your dog?
can I see from here without going outside?
alright.
you have a car in the back yard?
oh, there.
what does it play or sing?
it can sing to make jingle bells?
try it again.
use your finger.
oh.
did you tell Ursula about your school?
have you?
maybe one day.
when you're a little older and a little bigger.
David is eleven now.
did you try?
no.
I think so.
whatever you'd like to play.
Old_Mac_Donald.
what part of the house do you live in?
upstairs?
upstairs too?
he says he'd sharpen scissors and knives and gives you a year's guarantee.
oh, that's the lowest string.
the lowest sound.
see?
all the other ones should be higher than that.
a racing car?
where is it?
oh, I see.
but you went away for a while, didn't you?
do you want to tell me?
no, you didn't tell me anything about it.
for the sound.
maybe the hole is for the sound to come out.
that shows where to put your fingers.
do you think you're finished with the banjo?
do you know what they are?
those aren't cigarettes.
that's right.
I brought you that from Switzerland.
you can open it this way.
maybe we could do it on the table.
oh alright.
take out one piece at a time.
which piece do you want?
what do you want to make?
that's going to be nice.
goes down to what?
which ones?
you don't like those?
I do.
I like this one.
you can straighten it out.
you can roll it again.
that's right.
cheese!
will you make a sandwich?
never.
that's pretty.
you can make a man with his arms and legs and everything.
let's see.
what does he need?
no, that's not all.
now let's make a little ball and hide it inside here
now squeeze it and see what happens
now let's put a hunk of this in and see what happens, alright?
let's cover it all up, now see what happens.
nothing happens?
I think something will happen.
I think something will happen.
that's right.
let's make it all flat first.
now fold it up.
I don't think it will close if you put too many.
yes.
did you learn them in school?
did you tell Ursula what you do at school?
oh, that's delicious.
I wonder what happens if you mix these two.
what do you think it will make?
it will come off.
you can wash it off.
well, don't waste the clay.
look at that.
it's like a rainbow.
you can keep it.
that was for you.
are you?
very pretty.
oh no, thank you.
I'll just enjoy yours.
that's nice colors that you have there.
shall we make something with these?
oh how pretty.
and it lights up.
is that a real phone, Adam?
did you tell her our telephone number, Adam?
alright.
now what's our telephone number?
remember?
two six two.
one three seven eight.
I don't know.
this is a key.
the part of the what?
what kind of dog is that?
it did a little bit, see?
I thought we could make something for your doggie to eat.
what is that?
with how many legs?
I thought there were two back there.
you think the doggie would like some hotdogs?
what would the tiger like?
bananas?
a frank and a banana.
here's one banana.
here are two franks.
oh, you can do that.
you have to give him some nice strong legs to stand on.
does your tiger eat oranges?
can you make a basket?
can you make some more fruit?
alright, you make an orange, alright?
just make a little ball.
I'll make a handle for the basket.
you stretch it.
how about some grapes?
is he crying?
because you took a piece of leg?
why is he crying?
grapes.
ok.
write it on something?
how much do they cost, you tell me.
with a clock on it?
how much do they cost?
what time does the clock say?
ok.
ten cents, five cents, and one cent.
you could just stand it up.
there's a bunch of grapes.
they'll last a long time.
if you only give him two every day.
maybe he'd like an apple too.
do you?
no, I like this one, thank you.
that's right.
a what?
a carrot, of course.
oh.
you made a good one.
yes, just like you did.
you roll it and roll it.
is that right?
oh yes.
it's going to be a huge carrot.
it's going to be a huge big carrot.
yes.
over there too.
it'll get very thin.
here's your carrot.
that's as long as it can go.
I think so.
it's a snake.
isn't that the fruit basket?
no.
where?
ok.
yes.
mmhm.
can you put it in your ear?
what?
it's not.
I'm not.
why don't you play with the banjo?
I thought a banjo was all you wanted.
let's put these away first and you can have these.
alright?
alright.
you want toothpicks.
I don't know what else is in here.
careful, don't drop it.
what do you mean?
you mean on tv?
do you want to show your Mother what we made?
oh no.
can you blow?
that's all, Adam.
no, I think you've seen everything.
if she said yes it must be yes.
I bet you need what?
you do.
I didn't bring one.
I think you do need a string.
mmhm.
well, you can use a piece of my paper.
alright.
I don't have glue but I'll give you two pieces.
hold it up so Adam can see how it looks.
look at it.
you can make it.
oh, you know you can try.
I doubt that.
try.
oh.
you're making another one?
I'll go get it for you.
no.
shall I tear it for you?
what do you want me to tear?
right here?
oh alright.
what did you draw in school yesterday?
I don't understand how to play that game.
you pin those things on your back?
and then what do you do?
and then you don't let anybody look behind your back?
oh.
I have quite a ways to go.
alright.
that's not a banjo, that's a guitar.
Paul.
oh, what is it now?
oh, you changed it to what?
was it a clarinet?
oh, why don't you give her one of the ones that you had her make?
you need a better point.
let's see if we can sharpen it.
he's going to blow in the other room.
wait a minute.
wait til your mother comes in.
oh!
oh, you always want to keep something.
what was that game you were playing that I heard downstairs?
alright.
why do you do that?
the what?
show it to Mommy.
you take one and your mother takes one.
don't let it
you stay there.
you have to press the button to talk.
hello, Adam.
hello, Adam.
what are you doing?
what?
yes, Adam.
I heard you.
talking to Adam.
does it have an antenna?
yes, Adam.
where are you?
Adam.
ok.
I was in the forest.
these are nice.
I'll go out.
hello, Adam.
Rinny's outside playing.
you start talking.
I thought you said what is Rinny doing?
now I'll go all the way downstairs.
you go back in there.
what did you say?
hello, Adam.
how're you?
what did you say?
what did you say?
I'm sitting on the top stair.
can you hear me?
can you hear me?
press the button down.
what did you say?
you said.
Adam.
press the button down.
alright.
when you talk you have to press the button.
no, not with this, I don't think.
you'd have to use the telephone.
you'd probably need a bigger set.
that's just the case it came in.
don't put your mouth on it.
he'd have to have one too.
or something so he could hear you.
I don't think so.
you can go from one end of the street to the other.
go from one end of the street to the other.
ok, don't play with it, Adam.
you may break it.
well, maybe when you get a little bigger.
David's eleven years old.
no no.
you may break it.
I see a box over there.
why don't you look and see what else is in the box?
last time we went to get them they were out of them.
a game like Ursula brought for you.
alright.
oh, is that right?
you don't snap buttons, do you?
what a nice telephone bell.
we thought we'd try something different
it's so peculiar.
yes.
you don't ?
what do you think it is?
I don't think it's supposed to stick on the wall.
what else did you do in school today?
oh.
everyone else was running outside the circle.
you what?
oh, you were not in the circle.
you weren't supposed to be in the circle?
what kind of game were you playing?
oh, and left the boys in the room in a circle?
with the teacher?
maybe I'll build a Prudential Tower.
what, um
what happened to that school?
not very big but it's very tall.
peculiar.
oh, you don't mean peculiar?
how does that work out?
isn't that the way it works.
yes, I see.
yes.
yes, how are you going to make those?
alright.
how should we begin?
well, why don't you make a bottom for it?
here are the sliding_stairsc.
you're what?
to what?
does that mean escalators?
thank you.
what does that one say?
it says what?
no, I don't know how to make a monster.
yes please.
you need a what?
just one more.
I think he started to ask you something else and then changed it.
what is that?
that looks like the wheel of something.
I don't think it does.
a wheel.
do you have a building finished?
put it up here when it's finished.
put it back there.
what about that building there with the writing on it?
there.
it says garage.
mmhm.
what?
no, I think your Mother must have answered it.
if it rings again.
it looks nice.
I can't see it.

alright.
the little one is cafe and the big one is garage.
yes.
yes, it's easy.
what else do you need?
ssh!
surprise what?
oh.
ssh, take your time.
don't throw it, dear you may crack it.
honey, you shouldn't really throw these things.
these are for building.
you can throw a ball.
now no more throwing, alright?
Adam, no more throwing, please.
are there any more signs in there, Adam?
forty two meeting and the Williams street?
what does that mean?
thirty two.
thirty two Williams Street and Greenwich Park.
do what again?
thirty two Williams Street and Greenwich Park.
what's the number on Greenwich Park?
forty?
ninety?
where does eleven and one half come in?
these are made of plastic and they might crack.
then they wouldn't be nice to play with anymore.
no, she wouldn't give it to you if they were cracked.
she'd have to throw it away.
you couldn't play with it.
but Robin and David might not want broken toys.
a what?
did you tell Ursula we saw a train this morning?
a what?
choochoo model?
some trim?
shrimp?
what is shrimp?
stop throwing that.
oh, did some clay fall down there too?
no no.
if you've finished why don't you put them back in the box?
are you losing weight so that you're losing your pants?
well, you've been wearing them, haven't you?
these are bombs?
what happens when you drop a bomb?
oh.
why don't you start picking them up and putting them in the box?
yours.
that's right.
so it must not be yours, huh?
I don't see your Daddy.
I think I'll sit down.
how can I play when you're playing?
will you let Ursula play?
I don't know how.
I didn't play it.
you had it around my neck and you were playing it.
how can she?
I thought you asked her to play.
now give the pens to Ursula.
they write.
she needs pens for writing, you know.
do you want a piece of paper?
you do?
it will.
why don't you write your name?
oh, I can write some other time.
why don't you write this time?
are you going to pick the blocks up while I'm making what I want to
David probably doesn't even play with those anymore.
do you mean Robin?
what?
what do you think that has on it?
well, maybe you just can't see, huh?
hair!
I can't hold my hair up.
like this?
why would you do that?
oh, what are you going to do?
yes, it looks very pretty.
oh.
yes, that sounds better.
well, not particularly.
see how it's strung.
that sounded right.
what's that a violin?
you have to be careful.
you'll break David's guitar.
ok.
invisible?
oh, is that my name?
my name is Jesus?
